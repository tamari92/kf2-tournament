# Tournament Streamer Guidelines
This document is meant to give **Tournament Streamers** a few guidelines on streaming matches for the tournament.

First off, **thank you for volunteering to help with streaming matches!** As tournament streamers, we are the viewers' window to the action. Put simply, without you, this event would not be a success.

The following guidelines are intended to establish a set of standards designed to normalize all tournament-related streams. **These guidelines are required to be followed.** Feel free to ask the Tournament Director if you have any questions.


## Requirements
Every Tournament Streamer at minimum should:
```
1. Be able to run the game on MEDIUM to HIGH graphics settings (HIGH is preferred).
2. Have enough internet bandwidth and good enough hardware to stream at at least 1080p (1920x1080 or 1920x1200) resolution.
```


## I. Game Settings
Please set all KF2 Graphics options to the highest value(s) whenever possible to ensure the best quality image for the viewers. If nothing else, please make sure that at least Texture and Model Quality are set to **HIGH**.

Please turn off all in-game music. Some of the game's soundtrack is copyrighted material, which can lead to the stream's VOD being muted. Additionally, it can distract the viewers from being able to hear the commentators and the game itself.


## II. Game Modifications
Please remove/disable **any and all** visual, sound, or effect modifications (for example custom sounds) from your game before streaming matches.

The presence of these mods can detract from the production value / professionalism of the stream and in the case of some mods, can potentially hamper the viewer experience.


## III. Stream Resolution & Framerate
Please stream at *at least* **1080p** (`1920x1080` or `1920x1200`) resolution.

60 Frames per Second is strongly preferred, but not required.


## IV. Overlays & Stream Elements
Please disable/hide any non-essential stream elements so that as much of the game is viewable as possible.
This includes:
```
1. Video cameras of any type
2. Subscriber / alert feeds
3. Any notifications and/or alerts (subscriber notifications, raids, donations, etc)
4. Any overlays / visual elements that are not designed to be a border of some sort
5. STEAM overlay notifications and sounds
```
Furthermore, please set your streaming scene such that the game view takes up **the entire scene**.
Some streams have the game sectioned off on one specific part of the overlay. Please refrain from doing this as it makes it difficult to see what's going on for some viewers.


Here is a link to a hi-res version of the tournament banner:

The server already takes care of displaying this banner in-game to the spectators, however you are more than welcome to display this banner elsewhere on your stream (during AFK scenes, starting soon scenes, etc).

Other visualizations are recommended (but not required), such as the current state of the Playoffs brackets, or the current team standings during the Group Stage.
The team standings will be posted every week in the official tournament Discord Server.
A recommended use of these visualizations is showing them during any AFK or Starting Soon scenes so that viewers can get an idea of the current state of the tournament.

Here are some examples from my own stream. Feel free to copy if you'd like:

Here's an example of a good cast with great production quality and nice visuals:

## V. Server Specific Settings
By typing the `!settings` command into the **Chat Box** (T), the server's custom settings menu can be accessed.

Please make sure the following are in use for the stream:

Under the **Settings** tab:
```
Show ZED Time HUD                      True
Enable BW ZED Time                     True
Enable Custom Popups                   False
Exclude from Spectator Queue           True
Player Info Header                     Name Only
Enable Smooth Spectator Camera         True
Show Large ZED Kills                   True
```
Under the **Friendly HUD** tab:
```
Disable HUD                            True
```


## VI. Conduct
Please keep it professional. Your behavior directly reflects on the tournament organization as a whole.

In the event that a Tournament Streamer also functions as a **Commentator**, they should be as professional as possible and avoid using excessive foul language and/or behaving in a crude or immature manner.


## VII. Ownership
Tamari's KF2 Tournaments does not own the content you produce related to our tournament(s).

However, by agreeing to stream the matches, you consent to us downloading your VODs and uploading them to the official tournament channels (YouTube, etc).
