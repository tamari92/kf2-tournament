# Section 1: Introduction & Objective
### 1.1 - Objective
Welcome to the Tamari’s KF2 Summer Showdown 2023 CD Mentor Tournament!

This is a tournament for **KILLING FLOOR 2** centered around the **Controlled Difficulty** mod -- a mod which allows for fine tuning of difficulty-specific game variables and obtaining a level of consistency and intensity that drives a team experience simply not available in the vanilla game.

In this tournament, experienced players (Mentors) take on a group comprised of newer and other experienced players and attempt to perform the best they can in each match and earn the most Points! The ultimate goal of this tournament is not only to unite the community, but to give players (especially newer ones) the opportunity to learn and grow alongside experienced players in mechanical skill, game knowledge, and confidence in a (friendly) competitive environment where there is no fear of being judged. **If nothing else, the primary goal is to have FUN and make friends together!**

This tournament is hosted by **Tamari** & **Forrest Mark X**, and is (hopefully) the first of many to come.
There is no prize for winning, other than bragging rights, a whole lot of game knowledge, and maybe even some new friends to go with it!

### 1.2 - What is CD?
**Controlled Difficulty** (CD) is a mod originally created by **blackout** that allows for adjusting the game’s difficulty on a much more in-depth level than is normally possible.

Many of the game state variables within KF2 are controlled by the game's "Game Conductor". The **Game Conductor** is a system which is responsible for ensuring that the intensity and pacing of the experience is fitted to the team's skill, composition, and condition by adjusting certain variables on-the-fly.

Some examples of these adjustments include increasing and decreasing ZED health values based on how many players are currently connected to the game, increasing/decreasing the number of ZEDs in the wave based on the number of players, dynamically shifting the spawnrate of the ZEDs up and down depending on how well the team is doing, and many more.

While these adjustments are certainly interesting, they have the capability of introducing a level of variability that does not always contribute to a consistent, balanced, and team-oriented experience.

One of the pillars of CD's functionality is the ability to exert **full control** over these variables, by allowing one to set them to a **fixed value** that remains intact under all circumstances. **CD also allows for setting these variables far outside of their usual bounds**, allowing for creating scenarios in which the difficulty level is either easier or harder than what is normally available in the game.

Traditionally, CD has been used to create an experience that is equivalent to “harder than Hell on Earth” difficulty, however its main purpose actually lies in providing a *consistent* experience.

This makes it ideal for speed runs, challenges, and tournaments like this one!

Through CD, the following can be achieved:
- Static ZED health values
- Static ZED spawn rate
- Fleshpounds and Quarter Pounds never spawn enraged
- All waves have the same number of ZEDs
- All waves have the same composition of ZEDs
- All waves spawn ZEDs in the same order
- and a lot more, but these are the important ones..

### 3.2 - Format
The tournament will consist of two stages:
- [Group Stage](#321---group-stage)
- [Playoffs](#322---playoffs)

#### 3.2.1 - Group Stage
In the **Group Stage**, all teams play in a series of **rounds** with the goal being to achieve a favorable seeding for the **Playoffs.**

The Group Stage consists of **three rounds**, each lasting for **seven days**. Each round takes place on a predetermined map (one from the [Map Pool](#33---map-pool)) using predetermined [CD Parameters](#82---cd-parameters). These parameters will be announced the day the round officially begins. **For each round of the Group Stage, all teams play using the same parameters.**

There are no brackets in this stage. Instead, ALL teams play simultaneously and aim to achieve the best results they can for a given round. Matches are **scored** using a customized [Scoring System](#section-7-scoring) created specifically for this tournament.

Teams are responsible for **practicing, scheduling,** and eventually **playing** a single game per round using the required settings. The score earned for the match is taken as the team's score for that round. Once a team's score has been set for a round, it cannot be set again, barring administrative decisions/actions. A team's score for a round is added to a running total, to be used to determine the standings for the **Playoffs** bracket(s).

#### 3.2.2 - Playoffs
After the conclusion of the Group Stage, the **Playoffs** phase begins.

The Playoffs utilize a **6-Team Double Elimination Bracket** structure. To create the pairings, each team's cumulative score from the **Group Stage** is used to assign a "seed" to each team. The team with the highest cumulative score becomes the **1st Seed**, the team with the second-highest cumulative score becomes the **2nd Seed** and so on.

The pairings for each round are then made according to the following diagram:

![Summer Showdown 2023 Playoffs Bracket](https://i.imgur.com/Azs94pC.png)
(sourced from https://www.baberuthleague.org/media/11192/6team.pdf)

#### 3.2.2a - Winners Quarterfinals
The first round of the Playoffs is known as the **Winners Quarterfinals** and begins immediately after the conclusion of the Group Stage.

In this round, the **1st** and **2nd** Seeds receive a **bye**, which relieves them from playing in the round. Instead, they are safe from elimination and await the winners of this round in the upcoming **Winners Semifinals** round.

The remaining teams are then paired an in **"end-to-end"** scheme, meaning that the highest-seeded team plays against the lowest-seeded team, the second-highest team plays against the second-lowest seeded team, and so on.

This produces the following pairs:
```
3rd Seed VS 6th Seed
4th Seed VS 5th Seed
```

Each team then plays **two games** on a **single map**, determined through a series of [Map Bans](#331a---one-map-to-play). Each game to be played has a unique set of Objectives and Bosses, referred to herein as a "scenario". Scenarios each have unique Objectives, Bosses, and [CD Parameters](#82---cd-parameters). A team's total score for the round is the cumulative score across all scenarios to be played.

- The team with the highest total score across all scenarios wins the round and advances to the **Winners Semifinals**.
- The losing teams are dropped into the **Losers Bracket** and receive a **1 week bye** while they await their opponents, the losers of the **Winners Semifinals**, in the **Losers Quarterfinals**.

#### 3.2.2b - Winners Semifinals
The two teams that advance from the **Winners Quarterfinals** are paired against the **1st** and **2nd** seeds.

As in the **Winners Quarterfinals**, a single map is played for two scenarios. The map to be played is chosen through a series of [Map Bans](#331a---one-map-to-play). A team's total score for the round is the cumulative score across all games to be played.

- The winning teams advance to the **Winners Finals**.
- The losing teams are dropped into the **Losers Quarterfinals**.

#### 3.2.2c - Winners Finals
The **Winners Finals** pits the two teams that advanced from the **Winners Semifinals** against one another.

In this round, **two maps** are played instead of a single map (with multiple scenarios). The maps to be played are chosen through a series of [Map Bans](#331b---two-maps-to-play). A team's total score for the round is the cumulative score across all games to be played.

- The winning team advances to the **Grand Finals**, where they await the winner of the **Losers Finals**.
- The losing team is dropped into the **Losers Finals**.

#### 3.2.2d - Losers Quarterfinals
The four teams (total) that lost in the **Winners Quarterfinals** and **Winners Semifinals** are paired against one another in the **Losers Quarterfinals**.

In this round, a single map is played for two scenarios. The map to be played is chosen through a series of [Map Bans](#331a---one-map-to-play). A team's total score for the round is the cumulative score across all games to be played.

- The winning teams advance to the **Losers Semifinals**.
- The losing team that obtains the highest total score this round is eliminated from the tournament in **5th Place**.
- The losing team that obtains the lowest total score this round is eliminated from the tournament in **6th Place**.

#### 3.2.2e - Losers Semifinals
The two teams that advance from the **Losers Quarterfinals** are paired against one another.

In this round, a single map is played for two scenarios. The map to be played is chosen through a series of [Map Bans](#331a---one-map-to-play). A team's total score for the round is the cumulative score across all games to be played.

- The winning team advances to the **Losers Finals**.
- The losing team is eliminated from the tournament in **4th Place**.

#### 3.2.2f - Losers Finals
The **Losers Finals** pits the team that advanced from the **Losers Semifinals** against the loser of the **Winners Finals**.

In this round, a single map is played for two scenarios. The map to be played is chosen through a series of [Map Bans](#331a---one-map-to-play). A team's total score for the round is the cumulative score across all games to be played.

- The winning team advances to the **Grand Finals**, where they are awaited by the winner of the **Winners Finals**.
- The losing team is eliminated from the tournament in **3rd Place**.

#### 3.2.2g - Grand Finals
The final match of the tournament is held between the two teams that advanced from the **Winners Finals** and **Losers Finals**.

Similarly to the **Winners Finals**, each team plays **two games** on **two separate maps**, determined through a series of [Map Bans](#331b---two-maps-to-play). A team's total score for the round is the cumulative score across all games to be played.

- The winning team is the **tournament champion (1st Place)**.
- The losing team is eliminated from the tournament in **2nd Place**.

To win the tournament, the team that advanced from the **Winners Finals** only needs to win a single two-game series.

Meanwhile, the team that advanced from the **Losers Finals** must win two two-game series (achieve a higher total score) in a row to win the tournament. The first win achieved by the lower seed results in a "bracket reset", which resets all scores to 0 for the next two-game series. If the lower seed team wins again, they become the tournament champion.

#### 3.2.3 - Tiebreakers
In the event of a tie (both teams earning the exact same score) in *any* phase of the Playoffs, ties will be broken via the following scheme (considered in the order defined):
1. If only one team has suffered a full wipe (the game ended in DEFEAT) in either of their games, the team that has not wiped shall take victory
2. Sum up the Match Times (the value given by the custom tournament Timer -- NOT the scoreboard) for both teams' games. The team with the **lowest** Total Match Time across both of their games shall take victory.

### 3.3 - Map Pool
This list is subject to change at any time and does not necessarily represent the exact order the maps will be played.

#### 3.3.1 - Map Bans
For the **Playoffs** phase of the tournament, a smaller sub pool of maps (taken from the larger pool in [3.3](#33---map-pool)) will be assigned to each round. At the beginning of each round, team mentors take turns **banning** maps from the sub pool that they do not wish to play until a final choice is determined. The bans are overseen by either one of the **Tournament Directors** or an **Assistant Director** to establish legitimacy.

At the beginning of each round, the Mentors of teams participating in a given matchup will be contacted via a private Discord Thread (that only the involved teams can see) where they will be required to cast their bans. Both the order that bans are made and the number of maps to ban depends on the round in question (see below).

#### 3.3.1a - Arbitration
One important aspect of Map Bans is who chooses first. The order of bans contextually makes a difference depending on the teams goal, and isn't guaranteed to be fair to both teams in most cases. The solution put forth in this tournament is to designate one of the two teams as the "arbiter".
**The arbitrating team is granted the ability to choose who bans first**.

The conditions for determining the arbitrating team are as follows:
- Winners Quarterfinals: The lower seeded team is the arbiter
- Winners Semifinals: 
- Grand Finals: Same as Winners Semifinals
- All other phases: The team that earned the **lowest total score in their previous match** is the arbiter

After the ban order has been determined by the arbiter, both teams then follow the procedures outlined in [3.3.1c](#331c---two-maps-to-play)) and [3.3.1d](#331d---one-map-to-play)), depending on the round in question.

#### 3.3.1b - Equality
To establish an equally competitive setting, **all teams playing in a given round will be given the same subpool of maps.**

#### 3.3.1c - Two Maps To Play
When there are **two maps** to be played, the following procedures are in effect:
- 4 Maps in round Map Pool
- Each Mentor bans 1 Map, leaving 2 Maps to be played
- The order to play the two maps is determined by a coin toss

#### 3.3.1d - One Map To Play
When there is **one map** to be played, the following procedures are in effect:
- 3 Maps in round Map Pool
- Each Mentor bans 1 Map, leaving 1 Map to be played

#### 3.3.1e - Time Limits
To avoid delays, there are time restrictions set on casting bans.
- The first team (determined by the arbiter) has **12 hours** to cast their ban from the time the ban order is determined
- The second team (determined by the arbiter) has **12 hours** to cast their ban from the moment the first team makes their choice

#### 3.3.1f - Penalties
There are various penalties in place on Map Bans, as follows:
- If the first team to ban (determined by the arbiter) is unavailable or does not cast their ban *within 12 hours*, **the second team shall choose the map(s) to play.** The second team does not get to recast their own ban, but rather, make the first team's choice for them.
- If the first ban is made, but the second team (determined by the arbiter) does not make their ban *within the grace period or is unavailable*, **the first team shall choose the map(s) to play.** The first team does not get to recast their own ban, but rather, make the second team's choice for them.
- If both teams fail to make their bans or respond to the initial call *within 12 hours*, **the Tournament Directors shall choose the map(s) to play**

**Note:**  The Tournament Directors shall reserve the right to overrule these penalties or enact alternative solutions as deemed necessary to achieve the fairest outcome for all parties. This will only be exercised in extreme cases.


# Section 4: Registration Process
### 4.1 - Registration
The regular registration period begins **May 20, 2023** and closes on **June 21, 2023**, lasting exactly **32 days.**

### 4.2 - Double Registration
Players may not register to play in the same tournament more than once. Submitting multiple registrations will cause all registrations to be revoked and may result in further disciplinary action at the discretion of the Tournament Staff.

### 4.3 - Authentication
All players are required to submit their STEAMID64 during registration, which will be used to authenticate players.

**All players are required to use the account they sign up with for the entire tournament, or risk being removed from the tournament and barred from entering future Tamari's KF2 events.**

### 4.4 - Confirmation
Following their submission, all players are required to join the official tournament discord server and **contact one of the Tournament Directors or Assistant Directors** to confirm their signup.

This step is mandatory to prevent fraudulent signups and ensure that we have an accurate representation of who is actually participating.

If a player does not confirm their signup by the end of the signup phase, their submission will be dropped.

### 4.5 - Banned Players
Players who have already been banned from Tamari’s KF2 Servers for any reason are barred from participating in this tournament and any applications or sign-ups from these users will be discarded.

Players will be required to submit their STEAMID during the sign-up phase, which will be checked against our global bans list.

Integrity is of the utmost importance. If a Steam account possesses a **VAC Ban** or **Game Ban**, the account holder will be required to explain why they were banned. Refusing will be seen as suspicious and may result in the sign-up being revoked.

### 4.6 - Names
All players will be required to give a name during the registration phase. **Players will be required to use these names for the duration of the tournament.**

If a player must change their name, the Tournament Staff must be informed. It is permitted for players to make minor adjustments to their name (such as adding clan tags or symbols to denote their team) without having to inform the Tournament Staff.

**Names displaying obscenities or showing an overall lack of maturity or sensitivity will not be tolerated and can result in the team's suspension from the tournament.**

### 4.7 - Overflow Pool
Following the conclusion of the **regular registration** period, the **Overflow Pool** shall be formed. If more players have signed up than there are available Mentors, and there are not enough extra players to form a new team, the extra players shall be moved to the Overflow Pool. Players in the pool shall be **grouped by experience** (see [5.22](#522---player-grouping) for more information) and further prioritized by the date and time they signed up.

The purpose of this player pool is to function as a buffer of additional participants. In the event that a team loses players during the competition, the appropriate player group buffer shall be drawn from in order of priority in order to fill the vacant slot on the team.

After the regular sign-ups close, **players can continue to sign up for the tournament until the beginning of the first round of the Group Stage.** Players who sign up at this time shall be automatically placed into the Overflow Pool.


# Section 5: Team Structure
### 5.1 - Team Roster
A single team shall contain the following members in its roster:
- 1 **Mentor**
- 1 **Co-Mentor**
- 6 **Players**

Though there can only be six players in-game at a time, a full roster contains eight players, allowing for two backup players to be available in the event that players are unable to make it to the match.

### [Mentor]
The team’s **Mentor** shall be an experienced player who possesses a high degree of skill, knowledge, and experience within CD.

**The Mentor is the team leader and is ultimately responsible for their team.**

Mentors are primarily required to coordinate with Tournament Staff and other Mentors for scheduling matches and resolving disputes / other administrative-level endeavors. Mentors are typically handpicked by Tournament Staff, but players can opt to sign up to be a Mentor as well. In the second scenario, a review will be conducted by the Tournament Staff to determine eligibility. This will be based on several factors, including game time (hours) / general knowledge of the game, player attitude, and overall performance in CD matches.

**The Mentor’s secondary objective in this tournament is to act as a coach**, sharing their knowledge with their teammates and training them to improve their skill and game knowledge.

### [Co-Mentor]
The team's **Co-Mentor** shall be the secondary leader.

The Co-Mentor can be a player of any skill level that has not already been assigned to a team and is handpicked by the Mentor directly. The Co-Mentor is responsible for filling in for the Mentor when needed and is the Mentor’s primary support. Players who do not desire the full responsibility of leadership, but still want to be in a team-wide supporting role will likely find this position to be ideal. Like Mentors, players can sign up to be Co-Mentors as well.

### 5.2 - Team Formation
The formation of teams is conducted in five distinct phases:
- [Player Sign-ups](#521---player-sign-ups)
- [Mentor Assignment](#522---mentor-assignment)
- [Co-Mentor Assignment](#523---co-mentor-assignment)
- [Player Grouping](#524---player-grouping)
- [Player Draft](#525---player-draft)

#### 5.2.1 - Player Sign-ups
As in [4.1](#41---registration), players sign up to participate in the tournament through the supplied form. Sign-ups open the day the tournament is announced and remain open for **32 days.**

On the signup form, an option is given that allows the participant to specify their preferred role within the team, either **Mentor**, **Co-Mentor**, or **Player**. Note that a player’s specified preference may not reflect their actual assigned role when the teams are finally established.

The number of players that sign up directly influences the number of Mentors that can be chosen (and therefore the maximum number of teams).

#### 5.2.2 - Mentor Assignment
Next, **Mentors** are to be chosen/selected. Most of the time, these individuals will be chosen before the selection process even begins by the Tournament Staff directly. However, in the event that players have signed up to become Mentors, the Tournament Staff will review those applications at this time.

**The number of Mentor slots available is limited by the number of players participating in the tournament.** This is to ensure each team has a full roster.

#### 5.2.3 - Co-Mentor Assignment
Once the Mentors have been chosen, each will be asked to select a **Co-Mentor** to help them lead their team. **This can be anyone currently in the pool of registered players, regardless of skill level.**

Mentors will be informed of the players who have directly expressed an interest in being a Co-Mentor, however this does not mean that Mentors are necessarily required to choose those players.

**Co-Mentor selection is done on a first come first serve basis.**

There must be written confirmation from both the Mentor and the prospective Co-Mentor for the assignment to be finalized.

#### 5.2.4 - Player Grouping
After sign-ups close, the Tournament Staff will divide the registered players into **Player Groups** based on their experience level.

There are three Groups:
- **Group 1:** Players possessing a very high amount of experience within CD and who display a high level of mechanical skill, gamesense, and competence with multiple playstyles
- **Group 2:** Players possessing a high or above average amount of experience within CD and who display a high level of mechanical skill, gamesense, and competence with multiple playstyles
- **Group 3:** Players possessing an average amount of experience within CD
- **Group 4:** Players possessing a low amount of experience within CD
- **Group 5:** Players who are brand new to CD

These groups exist to better ensure a more even balance between teams and become relevant when the teams are actually filled out with players.

#### 5.2.5 - Player Draft
When all Mentor and Co-Mentor pairs have been established and the Player Groups have been formed, the **Player Draft** phase will begin. In this phase, the remaining players are selected by the Mentors using the previously-formed Player Groups.

To start the process, all Mentors will be placed into a hat and shuffled to produce a random ordering. **This represents the order in which the Mentors will choose prospective teammates.** Random ordering is used to prevent any bias and/or favoritism in the process.

Once the order has been set, actual assignment of the players will begin.

To start, Mentors will take turn choosing players from **Group 5** in a Round Robin fashion as per the order established previously. For example, the first Mentor picks a player, then the second, then the third, and so on. This process continues until all of the players in the group have been selected.

The same process then repeats for the players in **Group 4.**

..and so on, repeating until reaching the end of **Group 1.**

The result of this process is (hopefully) a set of teams which have a similar average skill level across their rosters due to the even distribution of players of varying experience.

**Note:** The Tournament Staff reserve the right to make adjustments to team rosters as they see fit to ensure the best possible balance. This, however, will only be exercised in extreme cases.

### 5.3 - Roster Integrity
Teams may *only* use the players in the rosters formed from [5.2.5](#525---player-draft). If a player leaves, exits, or is removed from the team, the team Mentor is required to inform the Tournament Staff immediately so that a replacement can be found (typically drawn from the overflow pool).

STEAMIDs will be checked regularly. **Using players not in the team’s assigned roster is grounds for the team's immediate suspension from the tournament.**

#### 5.3.1 - Alternate Accounts
**Alternate accounts are not allowed under any circumstances.** Please make sure that the account you intend to play on has full access to the game.


# Section 6: Match Scheduling
### 6.1 - Rounds & Scheduling
Pairings, brackets, and other pertinent information for each round will be posted by the Tournament Staff at the beginning of the round.

### 6.2 - Scheduling Duties
For all phases of the tournament, matches must be confirmed with the Tournament Staff at least **48 hours** before the projected match start time to allow for time to prepare.

**It is the responsibility of all Mentors involved in a given match to schedule and finalize match times with one another and relay these times to the Tournament Staff.**

For matches in the **Playoffs** phase, Mentors will also be required to submit their choices for [3.3.1](#331---map-bans)). See that section for more information.

### 6.3 - Scheduling Format
Team Mentors shall submit the following to the Tournament Staff when scheduling a match:
- The **Start Time** AND **Date** for the match, *with time zones*
- The preferred **server** (taken from the official list of tournament servers)

**Note:** In the event a scheduling conflict arises with another team, the Tournament Directors shall reserve the right to choose a server for the team or even mandate a schedule change (in the worst case scenario only) to assure that everyone can play.

### 6.4 - Scheduling Deadline
The **Scheduling Deadline** refers to the point in time after which teams are no longer able to schedule matches. Note that this does not mean the match must be *played* by this deadline, but rather *scheduled*.

In the **Group Stage**, the Scheduling Deadline is **48 hours** before the end of the round. For example, if the round ends on **Jan 6 @ 23:59 EST**, then the latest that a match can be scheduled for that round is on **Jan 4 @ 23:59 EST**, exactly **48 hours** before.

In the **Playoffs**, the Mentors from both teams are required to coordinate a time to play their games and relay this information to the Tournament Staff at least **48 hours** before the agreed-upon match start time. The earlier, the better, as it gives us more time to prepare a team of casters and streamers for each match.

### 6.5 - Matches With Multiple Games
#### 6.5.1 - Intermission
For matches where a single team plays multiple games (such as during the Playoffs), there must be **no scheduled intermission** between games. In other words, the games must be each be played "back-to-back". Teams are allowed a maximum of **ten minutes** between each individual game to be back in the server and readied up to begin the next game.

#### 6.5.2 - Substitutions
**Substitutions ARE allowed, but ONLY between games.** Substitutions **cannot** be made *during* a single game in a match, barring major emergencies, for which exceptions can and will be made within reason. Otherwise, there are no exceptions to this rule and violation will result in the team receiving a **zero score** for the match.

### 6.6 - Matches Between Two Teams
For matches that occur between two separate teams (for example during the Playoffs), **an eight hour grace period is to be granted between each teams' individual set of games.**

For example, if Team A schedules their game(s) on **March 1 @ 12:00 PM**, then Team B's game(s) must begin **no earlier than March 1 @ 4:00 AM (8 hours prior)** and **no later than March 1 @ 8:00 PM (8 hours after)**. Note that the eight hour grace period is applied relative to the **start time** of the **first game in the set** specifically, rather than the time the team finishes playing *all* of their game(s). This means that if Team A schedule to play their set of games at some time, then Team B has eight hours from that exact time to start their game(s). Team B need not *finish* their game(s) by the end of the grace period, but rather *start* them.

This grace period is to account for the differing timezones within an individual team and is aimed to ease some of the pressure of scheduling for the Mentors.

**If possible, the best case scenario would involve both teams playing back-to-back.** This situation would provide ultimate convenience for the teams as well as the Tournament Staff in attendence, but it is not necessary in the end.

Also, please note that **this is an international tournament.** By signing up to play, competitors are expected to understand that their opponents may be based in a distant time zone, which means that some or all players in a team may be required to play at inopportune / abnormal times throughout the day. To help remedy this, Mentors should be prompt and negotiate the schedule for the match as early as possible.

For all matches between two teams where each team plays multiple games in a row, the rules outlined in [6.5](#65---matches-with-multiple-games) still apply.

### 6.7 - Servers
Only specific servers may be used to play matches. If you are a participant, a list of servers can be found in the official Tournament Discord Server.

### 6.8 - Tardiness
Each team has **15 minutes** after the scheduled time to have six players in the server and readied up.

Please be on time. It is disrespectful to your opponents, the Tournament Staff who have given up some of their time to attend, and finally to the viewers who have committed time to watching the match. **Please plan to join the server 10-15 minutes before the start time to reduce the likelihood of being late.**

**The standard penalty for tardiness will be a zero score for the match.** In the Playoffs, this constitutes a **forfeit loss** in the event that one team is late to the match, or a **double forfeit** if both teams are late.

In the event one team is disqualified, **it is still required that the second team play their round in full.**

If something comes up that might affect the team’s ability to be present at the planned time, Mentors are required to inform the Tournament Staff as soon as possible so that accommodations can be made. The earlier we are informed, the better.

### 6.9 - No-shows
No-shows distort the results by unbalancing the tiebreakers. Moreover, they disappoint other competitors who have joined the tournament to participate in the competition.

If you wish to withdraw from the tournament, please notify one of the tournament directors by the start of the **second round** of the Group Stage.

In the Group Stage, if a team fails to appear to any match, a **zero score** will be assigned and that team must then contact Tournament Staff to confirm that they will play in the next round **by the scheduling deadline for that round**. Failure to do this will result the **team's removal from the tournament** without notice.

In the Playoffs, if a team fails to appear to any match, they will automatically **forfeit** the match. If neither team appears, a **double forfeit** occurs.

In the case of a double forfeit where the results of the match would determine one or more **final places** in the tournament for the teams involved, the team's seedings (relative to one another) shall be used to determine the final placements. The team with the more dominant seeding will obtain the higher final placing, and the team with the weaker seeding will obtain the lower final placing.

### 6.10 - Ringers & Substitutions
A **ringer** is a player not part of the team's active roster who substitutes to fill out the roster for a given match.
**Utilizing ringers is not allowed in this tournament**.

Substitutions **ARE** allowed, but **ONLY** using players from the team's **established** roster. Furthermore, substitutions can *only* be made **between** games in a set, and not *during* a game, barring extenuating circumstances. See [6.5.2](#652---substitutions) for more information.

The above regulation includes matches where multiple games are played in a row (e.g. during the Playoffs phase). See [6.5.2](#652---substitutions) for more information. Situations presenting extenuating circumstances will be handled as deemed appropriate by Tournament Staff at the moment of occurrence.

Additionally, teams are **not permitted** to add new players to their roster in the event that a member drops out of or is removed from the tournament. **Should a vacancy be created in a team for any reason, the team Mentor must inform the Tournament Staff as soon as possible so that a player may be drawn from the Overflow Pool.**

### 6.11 - Mentor Participation
**The Mentor and Co-Mentor are not required to play in matches in this tournament, however they are strongly encouraged to participate in order to better lead their team.**

### 6.12 - Proof of Play
"Proof of Play" refers to the team providing evidence or "proof" that a match was played in its entirety and with respect to the rules outlined in this document.

Proof of Play is **always** required, *EXCEPT* in the case that a match is streamed by an official Tournament Streamer.

When proof of play is required, the following **must** be provided:
1. A **recording** or **stream POV** of the match. This can be from any player on the team. Note that **spectators** are *not* allowed, so the player recording/streaming the match **must** be one of the active players. See [8.5](#85---spectators) for more information.
2. A screenshot of the end-game scoreboard *with all players present*

**ALL** of the above items are required to serve as suitable Proof of Play. **This means that all matches must be recorded and/or streamed by at least one player on the team.** The team's **Mentor** must deliver these directly to the one of the Tournament Directors within **24 hours** following the conclusion of the match.

In the best case, failure to provide proof of play will result in a team being forced to **replay the match**. The replayed match will be subject to the **Scheduling Deadline**, should one exist.
In the worst case, a team will earn a **zero score** for the match.

**Please be honest. All match results will be recorded by the server automatically. If a screenshot/recording/etc does not match our recorded statistics, it will be considered cheating and the team may be disqualified from the tournament entirely.**

### 6.13 - Multiple Attempts
#### 6.13.1 - Group Stage
In the **Group Stage**, teams are permitted a **single retry** at a match in the event that the squad is wiped out before the beginning of **Wave 6.** Retries add extra time to the match, so this regulation is upheld with consideration of the time of the Tournament Staff involved as well the audience.

**In the event that the second attempt results in a VICTORY (boss killed), the team suffers a 50% reduction to the Total Score earned**. This reduction occurs **after** all bonuses and penalties are applied to the Total Score. The score reduction cannot reduce the team's score beyond the maximum value of the Completion Score (CS) for the match. See [Section 7: Scoring](#section-7-scoring) for more information.

Additionally, if the second attempt results in a VICTORY (boss killed), **the newly-earned score supersedes the score earned in the original attempt, even if the original score was higher.**

In the event that a crash occurs (either player or server), a retry may be granted by the Tournament Staff. See [6.14](#614---loss-of-connection) for more information. Retries as a result of a loss of connection are considered separately from retries made as the result of the squad being wiped out.

Otherwise, there are no exceptions to the above regulations, though the Tournament Staff shall retain the right to make them as deemed necessary.

#### 6.13.2 - Playoffs
In the Playoffs phase, **multiple attempts are strictly forbidden** except in the case where a crash occurs. See [6.14](#614---loss-of-connection) for more information. This is due to the longer nature of Playoffs matches and is upheld with consideration of the time of the Tournament Staff involved as well the audience.

There are no formal exceptions to the above regulations, though the Tournament Staff shall retain the right to make them as deemed necessary.

#### 6.13.3 - Integrity & Sportsmanship
Retries may **only** be used in the situations outlined in [6.13.1](#6131---group-stage)/[6.13.2](#6132---playoffs) **and** if the current stage of the tournament permits it. **It is considered bad sportsmanship to purposely throw the game or manipulate the game's state in order to earn a retry.** Tournament Staff reserve the right to enact disciplinary measures if it is determined this is being abused.

For matches that are not streamed by an official Tournament Streamer, *Proof of Play* (described in [6.12](#612---proof-of-play)) is required. **Records of all tournament matches played on the Match Servers are kept automatically by the server.** These reports will clearly display tampering should a team attempt to abuse this clause.

**It is considered a breach of Competitive Integrity to make more attempts at a match than are allowed, especially if the team attempts to hide or obfuscate the results of these attempts from the Tournament Staff in any way. Consequences for violation at minimum involve the team being assigned a zero score for the round, and at maximum, explusion from the tournament entirely and banned from all future events held by the Tamari's KF2 community.**

### 6.14 - Loss of Connection
There are situations in which either the clients or the server may lose connection. These are handled separately in two subcases:

#### 6.14.1 - Client Disconnects
In the event that players crash or are disconnected involuntarily at other points throughout the match, Tournament Directors and Assistant Directors reserve the right to adjust all Score and Bonus values as well as the Match Timer to compensate if the situation presents extenuating circumstances. **There is no guarantee in these scenarios and the Tournament Director and Assistant Directors are the court of last resort for deciding whether or not points are to be reimbursed.** Their decisions are final and cannot be appealed.

#### 6.14.2 - Server Disconnects
In the event that the **server** itself crashes or otherwise loses connection, Tournament Directors in attendance are **permitted** to set the game state, which includes:
- Setting the wave manually
- Granting Dosh to players
- Setting Score and Bonus values manually
- Setting the Match Timer manually

... so that play may resume as normal.

In situations where a match was not streamed by an official Tournament Streamer, incontrovertible evidence must be provided to the Tournament Director(s) and Assistant Director(s) that shows that the server crashed on its own without the direct interference of any of the players present before any actions can be taken.

#### 6.14.3 - Restarts
In the event of a Loss of Connection, a team may request a restart with no penalty provided that the event occurred **prior to the beginning of Wave 3**. After the beginning of Wave 3, restarts in the wake of a crash or disconnect shall (formally) be forbidden. This is primarily for the respect of the time of all parties involved in the match as well as the spectators/viewers.

It shall be the responsibility of the Tournament Staff in attendance (specifically the Assistant Directors and/or the Director) to approve/deny a request to restart in the wake of a client or server crash/disconnect. Only one restart may be made **per match** in this manner. Should a match consists of multiple games, **only one restart** shall be allowed between all games.

After a restart, should further action be necessary, the Assistant Director and/or the Director shall be permitted to take action as they see fit to resolve the situation. In general, the Assistant Directors and/or the Director shall retain the authority to partially or completely supersede this clause at their own discretion should circumstances warrant it.

#### 6.14.4 - Integrity & Sportsmanship
As in [6.13.3](#6133-integrity---sportsmanship), integrity and sportsmanship are demanded from players in regards to the above clauses.

For client disconnections, it is seen as a breach of Competitive Integrity to frame an intentional disconnection as a crash or loss of internet service with the intent of achieving an advantage or otherwise circumventing the rules. For server disconnections, it is seen as a breach of Competitive Integrity to intentionally abuse an exploit or bug that would cause the server to crash or disconnect players with the intent of achieving an advantage or otherwise circumventing the rules. 

Consequences for violation at minimum involve the team being assigned a zero score for the round, and at maximum, explusion from the tournament entirely and banned from all future events held by the Tamari's KF2 community.

### 6.15 - Oversight
Teams are permitted to ask a Tournament Director or Assistant Director to be present at the match to provide oversight and resolve any disputes.


# Section 7: Scoring

**Teams are NOT permitted to decline their match(es) being streamed.**

**All members of a team ARE permitted (and are welcome) to record, stream, and upload their matches to their personal media accounts.** The tournament organization does not own the content players produce from their matches.

For matches that are streamed on the official channels, commentators and streamers will be present to shoutcast the match.

Though they are part of the Tournament Staff, commentators and streamers are **NOT** admins. Should an issue arise that requires the attention of an admin, one of the tournament directors should be contacted immediately.

Despite this, commentators and streamers still exercise some control over the match as **referees**. Should something occur that either partially or completely violates one of the rules, they are permitted to ask the offending players to stop or take other appropriate actions within reason.

If all else fails, a Tournament Director should be informed as soon as possible so that appropriate further action can be taken.

**The tournament organization does not own the content created from the matches by the commentators and streamers.** Commentators and streamers are free to upload their recordings to their own media channels, however the Tournament Staff is also permitted to download and upload the recordings to the official tournament channel(s).

As stated in [2.4](#24---conflicts-of-interest), **Tournament Commentators** and **Streamers** who are also playing in the tournament are subject to the following restrictions:
- Streaming/commentating of ANY matches directly involving the streamer's/commentator's own team is strictly forbidden.
- For matches in any round of the Group Stage, it is forbidden to stream a match UNLESS the match takes place at a time AFTER the streamer's/commentator's own team's match has already completed for that round.
- Streaming/commentating is forbidden in the Playoffs stage if the streamer's/commentator's team is still a part of the tournament at the time the match takes place.

### 8.4 - Voice Chat
Teams will each be assigned a Voice Channel in the Tournament Discord Server that they are **required** to use for the match, even if they do not intend to use it to communicate with one another.

Furthermore, **only the players currently playing in the match are allowed to be in Voice Chat.** Both the Mentor and Co-Mentor are subject to this rule as well. Violating this will result in receiving a **zero score** for the match and possible suspension from the tournament.

#### 8.4.1 - War Rooms
War Rooms will be utilized in this tournament. A War Room refers to the streamers and commentators occasionally dropping into the team’s Voice Chat room to “listen in”. War Rooms will typically last for about 30 seconds and will only occur a few times per match.

**Teams are allowed to veto the use of their Voice Channel as a War Room.** The team Mentor must inform the Tournament Staff of this decision prior to the match Start Time.

Commentators will not speak nor create any distractions when entering a channel, and players should generally not feel disturbed by their presence.

### 8.5 - Spectators
Aside from Tournament Staff and other authorized parties (such as commentators and streamers), no Spectators will be allowed in the server at any time during a match.

This includes members of the team who are not playing in the match. If a non-participating team member joins the server as a spectator, the team will receive a **zero point score** for the round.

### 8.6 - Perks
#### 8.6.1 - Perk Levels
All player Perks will be temporarily forced to Level 25 using serverside modifications.

#### 8.6.2 - Perk Limits
There are limits in place on the Perk composition the team can possess at any given time:
- Maximum **ONE of each:** Berserker, Field Medic, Commando, SWAT, Support, Demolitionist, Firebug, Survivalist
- Maximum **TWO of each:** Sharpshooter, Gunslinger
- Maximum **TWO total** from the group:
  - Berserker
  - Demolitionist
  - Firebug
  - Survivalist
- **Field Medic** and **Demolitionist** are mutually exclusive and cannot co-exist in a squad

These limitations are **strictly** enforced. Not adhering to the requirements will result in the team receiving a **zero score** for the match!

#### 8.6.3 - Perk Swapping
In the Lobby, players are freely allowed to change Perks, however after the match starts, **players will no longer be able to select a new Perk for the remainder of the match.**

#### 8.6.4 - Perk Skills
There are no restrictions on the changing of **Perk Skills** in this tournament. Players can alter their Perk's skills as often as they desire during the Trader period.

### 8.8 - Mechanics
Several game mechanics have been modified for use in this tournament. The modifications made are as follows:

#### ZED Stomping (aka "Goomba Stomping")
ZED Stomping has been reverted to its pre-nerf state.
This means that any and all ZEDs can be stomped (excluding bosses) and there is also no cooldown on stomps.

#### Perk Skills that alter Maximum Health
In the base game, some Perk Skills can be exploited to infinitely earn money, namely those skills which increase or decrease the player's maximum health.

These skills have been modified such that the player will now be automatically completely healed should their health already be at 100% upon switching skills. If the player's health is below 100%, their health will not be set automatically. This is to allow Field Medics to heal the player and earn Dosh from the healing. However, once the player is at 100% Health, it is impossible to lose health due to players being invincible during the Trader period, which prevents money from being earned again.

The skills affected include:
```prolog
1. Berserker: Dreadnaught
2. Commando: Tenacious
3. Support: Fortitude
4. Field Medic: Symbiotic Health
```

### 8.9 - Map Objectives
Throughout the match, objectives in the form of “Stand Your Ground” zones will appear. Some maps have built-in objectives as well, such as KF-Airship.

Completing these objectives grants **200 Objective Bonus Points** to the team (see [Section 7: Scoring](#section-7-scoring) for more information on this).

For a given map, Stand Your Ground objectives will appear at a static location on each wave they are offered. This does not necessarily mean that they will always appear at the same location for all waves, but rather that they will always appear at the same location on that wave in particular. Furthermore, SYGs will appear on the same waves for each run of an individual map to keep things fair for all teams.

If the next wave has a set objective, the Objective Zone will be **highlighted** in the world (and on the HUD) during the Trader period. This is so that players can take note of the exact position of the zone and adjust their strategies as necessary.

### 8.10 - Trader Time
During Trader Time, the following is in effect:
- **ALL** Trader Pods in the map are open simultaneously
- Trader Timer increased to **120 seconds** (2 minutes)
- Players move at **150%** movement speed
- The **!ot** and **!fs** commands are disabled

All Trader Pods are open to ensure equality and fairness across runs and to help prevent random factors from influencing the outcome of the match. The additional time and increased movement speed are necessary to allow teams to properly prepare for the next wave.

**The Trader Timer will not pause automatically.** Although this is the typical behavior in CD, it is restricted in this tournament to prevent teams from consuming an unfair amount of time during the Trader period to prepare. It is not possible for teams to vote to Pause (!pt) or Unpause (!upt) the Trader.

### 8.11 - Custom Interface
#### 8.11.1 - Player Interface
![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/X0AcXfa.png)

During the match, players will find that a new **Match Timer** has been added at the top-middle of their screen.

This timer shows the following:
- Total **duration** of the current match (excluding any time spent in the Lobby)
- The **PENALTY Time** for the map

The timer begins counting the moment the round begins and never stops, even during the Trader period. See [Section 7: Scoring](#section-7-scoring) for more information on the PENALTY Time.

#### 8.11.2 - Spectator Interface
![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/t60s5Pp.png)

Similarly to players, **spectators/viewers** also have a custom interface for this tournament.

This HUD shows the following information:
1. The **Match Timer**
2. The current **Score** of the match, including all Bonuses
3. A full readout of the team’s **condition**.

As with the Player Interface, the **Match Timer** on the Spectator Interface shows the current total time elapsed for the match, not including any time spent in the Lobby. The PENALTY Time is visible as well.

The Score shown in **2)** reflects the total number of Points the team has earned thus far for the match as well as a complete breakdown of the state of the team’s Bonus Point pools. The values shown update in real time.

**3)** shows a complete technical readout of the conditions of each member of the team.

The following information can be viewed in real time:
- The player’s **Health** and **Armor**
- The player’s current **Perk**
- The player’s **currently-equipped Weapon** as well as the amount of **ammunition** loaded and available
- The total number of **Kills** and **Assists** the player has
- The total amount of **Dosh** the player possesses
- The total amount of **weight** the player is carrying in their loadout
- The total number of **grenades** the player has in their inventory

Additional information will appear (and disappear) periodically to show the following:
- Painted Targets
- Painted Target Health Bars
- Map Objective Progress
- Boss Health Bars

# Section 9: Competitive Integrity
Participants have a duty to conform to the generally accepted standards of fair play. Deviation from those standards is cheating, and threatens the legitimacy of the competition as a whole. Therefore, everyone shall be held to a strict standard of competitive integrity.

### 9.1 - Penalties
The minimum penalty for a breach of competitive integrity is a match loss by forfeit. There is no maximum penalty, which may include team expulsion from the tournament, forfeiture of already played matches, and forfeiture of team eligibility for any prizes.

#### 9.1.1 - Guilt by Association
An entire team may be held responsible for any team member who is found to be breaching competitive integrity. If foul play is suspected, the team must inform Tournament Staff as soon as possible so that the situation can be addressed. The outcome of this situation depends on various factors, and significant proof will be needed to take any degree of action.

**In scenarios involving a breach of competitive integrity, inaction or lack of cooperation from the team may be seen as a suggestion of possible complicity.**

### 9.2 - Stream Sniping
In matches where two teams play against one another, both teams are required to refrain from viewing each other's streams / shoutcasts until the match has concluded and a winner has been decided.

In the Group Stage, **all teams are required to refrain from watching the other teams' matches until the conclusion of the round,** after which VODs from all matches will be posted.

### 9.3 - Cheating
**ANY form of cheating, whether through external software or in-engine methods, is absolutely prohibited.**

Cheating ruins the integrity of the sport, undermines the efforts of everyone involved in keeping the game fun and fair, and is a direct form of disrespect to both your team and the tournament administration.

Should a member of a team be caught cheating, the cheater at minimum will be immediately removed from the tournament and banned from all future events as well as from Tamari’s KF2 servers entirely.

### 9.4 - Permitted Game Modifications
#### 9.4.1 - Crosshairs
Use of a **crosshair** of any sort is permitted in this tournament.

#### 9.4.2 - INI Edits
The term “INI Edit” refers to a change made to the game’s base configuration files.

The only INI Edits which are allowed are those which reflect settings already available in the game's built-in options menu, for example:
- Altering video settings to improve performance
- Altering or setting keybinds
- Altering gore/particle/FX settings to improve performance

ALL other edits are **forbidden** and will be seen as a breach of competitive integrity.

Edits which attempt to completely remove objects from the environment in order to make it easier to see or navigate are especially forbidden, as are edits which attempt to alter the behaviors of weapons, corpses, or thrown objects in any way, as they give players an unfair competitive advantage.

The tournament servers restrict most of these values and enforces them to their defaults should they be found to be in use.

#### 9.4.3 - Local Game Files
The local game files that can be changed are:
- Weapon Skins
- Weapon Sounds
- Game Music
- Menu Sounds / FX

ALL other changes not in the above list are **forbidden** and will be seen as a breach of competitive integrity.

Changes to ZED models & sounds which attempt to make it easier to see or hear them, and changes to any environmental textures or sounds in an attempt to make it easier to see or navigate the environment are especially forbidden, as they give players an unfair competitive advantage.

The tournament servers restrict the use of alternate ZED models, which ensures that the ZED hitboxes remain intact for all players.

### 9.5 - Prohibited Game Modifications
All other modifications, edits, tools, and utilities NOT listed in [9.4](#94---permitted-game-modifications) are **prohibited** and will result in disciplinary action should it be discerned that a team / player is taking advantage of them.


# Section 10: Exploits
### 10.1 - Permitted Exploits
Though the following exploits are allowed, Tournament Staff and commentators reserve the right to ask players to refrain if they feel they are being abused in a way that reflects unsportsmanlike conduct, distasteful intent, or are otherwise excessive in nature. Failure to comply can result in earning a zero score for the round, or possibly more, dependent on severity. Tournament Staff have full discretion in these matters and are not required to justify their decision(s).

#### 10.1.1 - Reload Cancelling

Examples
- https://youtu.be/4__nURtj_u4

#### 10.1.6 - Looping
Moving in such a way that causes a ZED to become stuck in an infinite movement cycle without being able to reach the player is permitted in this tournament, **except against Bosses.**

Examples

#### 10.1.7 - Overcapping
Overcapping weapons through any means is permitted in this tournament.

#### 10.1.8 - Emote Reloading
The use of an emote while reloading a weapon is permitted in this tournament.

### 10.2 - Prohibited Exploits

#### 10.2.1 - AI Stuck Spots
Utilizing any spots in a map which cause ZEDs to become completely stuck and unable to move / attack is prohibited.


# Section 11: Unsportsmanlike Conduct
Each participant is expected to conduct themselves respectfully toward others at all times. Abusive, harassing, disrespectful, or otherwise unsportsmanlike conduct will not be tolerated -- neither during a tournament match, nor in any other context.

### 11.1 - Penalties
The minimum penalty for unsportsmanlike conduct is a match loss by forfeit. There is no maximum penalty, which may include team expulsion from the tournament, forfeiture of already played matches, and forfeiture of team eligibility for any prizes.

#### 11.1.1 - Guilt by Association
An entire team may be held responsible for the unsportsmanlike conduct of any team member. Should problems arise within a team, the members of that team are expected to present the issue to the Tournament Staff so that further action can be taken.

**In scenarios involving unsportsmanlike conduct, inaction or lack of cooperation from the team may be seen as a suggestion of possible complicity.**

### 11.2 - Insufficient Effort to Win
Any competitor who, in the judgment of a staff member, has not committed to winning the match is guilty of unsportsmanlike conduct.

### 11.3 - Delay of Game
Intentionally stalling or delaying the progress of the match will be regarded as unsportsmanlike conduct.

This includes but IS NOT LIMITED to:
- Excessive and/or lengthy use of the game pause feature
- Excessive time spent in the Trader period without readying up
- Excessive time spent completing the wave (such as leaving ZEDs alive without killing them)

These actions disrupt the normal flow of the match and frustrate the expectations of the spectators and other players. They will be regarded as unsportsmanlike conduct if it is judged by staff to be excessive, regardless of the reason. Tournament Staff have full discretion in these matters and are not required to justify their decision(s).

### 11.4 - Communication to Harass or Impede
Any form of **written, verbal, or other communication** or actions which are excessive, toxic, or otherwise meant to harass players or impede the progress of the match will be regarded as unsportsmanlike conduct.

This includes but IS NOT LIMITED to:
- Excessive use of text chat in the form of binds or callouts that are spammy in nature (grenade binds are okay)
- Excessive use of text chat in the form of binds or callouts that are toxic or meant to mock/taunt other individuals
- Excessive use of voice chat that does not reflect traditional team communication norms or are spammy and/or obnoxious
- Use of movement mechanics and/or animations which aim to mock or taunt individuals (t-bagging, etc)

These actions disrupt the normal flow of the match and frustrate the expectations of the spectators and other players. They also display a toxic disregard for common courtesy, respect, and maturity and have the capability to hurt the public image of the tournament as a whole. They will be regarded as unsportsmanlike conduct if it is judged by the Tournament Staff to be excessive, regardless of the reason. Tournament Staff have full discretion in these matters and are not required to justify their decision(s).

### 11.5 - Lack of Professionalism
Any competitor who displays a **lack of professionalism** within their team or to their opponent(s) is guilty of unsportsmanlike conduct.

This includes but IS NOT LIMITED TO:
- In the event of a loss, failing to acknowledge the outcome of the match in a mature and positive way (ie: being a "sore loser")
- Flammatory, abusive, or otherwise toxic behavior toward teammates or opponents for any reason (see [11.4](#114---communication-to-harass-or-impede))
- Excessive celebration and/or behavior akin to "rubbing it in" to teammates or opponents

Just play nice and say GG when the match is over, no matter who wins, and remember that this is just a game. Of all of the forms of unsportsmanlike conduct listed in this section, these will be held to the highest standard. A lack of professionalism and courtesy hurts the event as a whole and frustrates the expectations of the players who have signed up to play in the event.

### 11.6 - Player Avatars
Do not use Steam Avatars that are grotesque, violent, obscene, or depict other disturbing or offensive imagery such as sexually explicit content, racist logos, or “shock” images. These will not be tolerated and can result in suspension from the tournament.

Players who violate these rules will be given one chance to change their avatar, after which they will be removed from the tournament entirely.

### 11.7 - Respect the Server Hosts
Server hosts invest time and money to provide and maintain servers at no charge to anyone using them. This competition depends on their continued generosity. Therefore, do not break the rules of the server being used for the current match(es).
