# Tournament Commentator Guidelines
This document is meant to give **Tournament Commentators** a few guidelines on casting matches for the tournament.

First off, **thank you for volunteering to help with casting matches!** As commentators, we not only entertain the audience, but provide insightful commentary and "fill in the gaps" (so to speak) for the viewers as well. The best commentary blends together a high level of energy, excitement, and enthusiasm with a keen eye, attention to detail, and insightfulness. These ideals come together to enhance the experience of watching the match and make for some truly memorable experiences.

The following guidelines are intended to establish a set of standards designed to normalize all tournament-related casts. **These guidelines are required to be followed.** Feel free to ask the Tournament Director if you have any questions.

## Requirements
Every Tournament Commentator at minimum is expected to:
1. Be able to articulate clearly and effectively. As of right now, all streams are in English, so fluency in English is a must.
2. Be able AND willing to commentate in a manner that is free of any bias/judgement toward or against specific teams, players, 
or individuals participating in the match.
3. Display a tremendous level of maturity, professionalism, and discipline and understand that their behavior has the capability 
of reflecting on the entire event, both negatively and positively.
4. Utilize push-to-talk or push-to-mute. No open mics are allowed, especially with War Rooms!

## Procedure
The general procedure of a cast goes as follows:

Before starting, determine which caster is going to be the leader. The **Lead Commentator** is responsible for giving the introduction and also moving the casters and streamers into and out of War Rooms during the match.

**At the start of the match...**
1. Lead Commentator greets the viewers and introduces the match (what team is playing, what the map is, what stage of the 
tournament we're in -- eg: Group Stage Round 1, and so on)
2. Lead Commentator introduces themself, the other casters, and the streamer in attendance (and also gives them a chance to say 
hello so that people can hear their voice)
3. Roster rundown is given (state the team's players and what perk they are playing). This can be done by anyone, though it helps 
to have the Lead Commentator pass this off to someone else (e.g. "So and so, want to go ahead and give us a roster rundown?")
4. Quick discussion about the match (state of the tournament, talk about possible strategies, and so on)

**During the match...**
1. Commentators come to a general agreement on times to enter the team's War Room. **The Lead Commentator moves the Streamer over to the War Room and brings them back to the caster voice channel (via dragging their Discord user).** 
See below for some examples of good times to enter the team's War Room.
2. Commentators discuss the match state and give detailed insight into the occurring events

**At the end of the match...**
1. Lead Commentator asks the team if they'd like to interview, and if so, moves the specified players into the voice chat room 
(keep interviews no more than 10 minutes long).
2. Lead Commentator thanks the viewers for watching and reminds them to tune into the next matches / check out previous matches 
that have already happened.

Here is an example of what I consider to be a good intro AND outro of a cast:

## I. Conduct
Please act professional. Your behavior directly reflects on the tournament organization as a whole.

Avoid the following:
- Argumentative / inflammatory / negative remarks about players, staff, or otherwise.
- Overuse of crude and/or vulgar language. Swearing as a reaction is one thing, but swearing just to swear is another thing 
entirely and it can severely detract from the professionalism of the stream.


## II. War Rooms
A War Room refers to the commentators "dropping in" to the team's voice chat and listening in on their comms with the main purpose typically being to provide more personalized insight about the match state from the team's perspective.

There are no mandated intervals for which War Rooms can be utilized, except for when the team vetoes the use of their chat room as a War Room. Should that be the case, the Captain is required to give written confirmation to the casters that they do not wish to be disturbed for the duration of the match. If no such confirmation is received, **explicitly in writing**, then the team currently playing the match maintains **no expectation of privacy**. Should War Rooms be available for a match, they can be listened in on as long as all casters agree.

During a War Room, there is to be **no talking or distractions** from the present streamers and commentators. As far as the players are concerned, we should be ghosts that are merely there to watch and then leave after a short while. **Talking can be very disruptive to the team and have an impact on the results of the match.**

While Commentators are not necessarily required to use a War Room if it exists, they should only aim to use them 2-4 times per match at maximum.

Some ideal moments to drop into the team's voice chat are:
1. At the moment the team decides to initiate a kite on Waves 7-10
2. During moments where the team is in a dangerous situation (such as during a clutch or a last man standing scenario)
3. During the Boss Wave


## III. Stream Chat
There will be at least one official Tournament Streamer in attendance at every game. The streamers' responsibilities are to broadcast the match to the viewers.

**Please do NOT verbally interact with the streams' viewers during the match.** The only exception to this is during any postgame interviews conducted by the commentator(s) (see below) or before the match begins.

The streams' viewers are purely spectators and should have no bearing on the game whatsoever.


## IV. Interviews
Following the game's conclusion, **interviews** may be conducted with players from the match. These sessions allow both the staff and the viewers to gain more insight about the team's experience in the match and also allow the players to decompress. Interviews are generally very entertaining and are usually a great conclusion to a cast.

Interviews are subject to the following guidelines:
1.  Interviews shall only be conducted if the Tournament Streamer in attendance has time to stream the full interview. Please 
ask the streamer in attendance before the match starts if you know you'd like to conduct interviews.
2.  For matches where two teams are playing, interviews shall only be conducted **after both teams have played** to avoid 
delaying the subsequent matches.
3.  For matches where a team plays multiple games in a row, interviews shall only be conducted **after all games are complete** 
to avoid delays.
4.  Interviews shall extend no longer than 20 minutes per team.
5.  Interview questions shall not be framed in any way which is derogatory, inflammatory, and otherwise negative or contains 
strict bias against the players, the team, and the team's performance. In other words, do not ask questions which belittle or 
make players feel uncomfortable. Always give players the benefit of the doubt by giving them the opportunity to decline answering 
the question(s) should they desire.
6.  Players and teams are allowed to decline an interview entirely. Following the conclusion of the match, either ask directly in 
the in-game chat or DM the team's Captain (via Steam or Discord) to ask them if they'd like to participate in an interview. 

Should a team decline the interview, do not pressure them.


## V. Media & Ownership
As tournament commentators you are more than welcome to **record, stream, and archive** your casts. Tamari's KF2 Tournaments does not own the content you produce related to our tournament(s).
