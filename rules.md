# Section 1: Introduction & Objective
### 1.1 - Objective
Welcome to the Tamari’s KF2 Summer Showdown 2022 Tournament!

This is a tournament for **KILLING FLOOR 2** centered around the **Controlled Difficulty** mod -- a mod which allows for fine tuning of difficulty-specific game variables and obtaining a level of consistency and intensity that drives a team experience simply not available in the vanilla game.

The objective of this tournament is not only to unite the community, but to give players (especially newer ones) the opportunity to learn and grow alongside experienced players in mechanical skill, game knowledge, and confidence in a (friendly) competitive environment where there is no fear of being judged. **If nothing else, the primary goal is to have FUN and make friends together!**

This tournament is hosted by **Tamari** & **Forrest Mark X**, and is (hopefully) the first of many to come.
There is no prize for winning, other than bragging rights, a whole lot of game knowledge, and maybe even some new friends to go with it!

### 1.2 - What is CD?
**Controlled Difficulty** (CD) is a mod originally created by **blackout** that allows for adjusting the game’s difficulty on a much more in-depth level than is normally possible.

Many of the game state variables within KF2 are controlled by the game's "Game Conductor". The **Game Conductor** is a system which is responsible for ensuring that the intensity and pacing of the experience is fitted to the team's skill, composition, and condition by adjusting certain variables on-the-fly.

Some examples of these adjustments include increasing and decreasing ZED health values based on how many players are currently connected to the game, increasing/decreasing the number of ZEDs in the wave based on the number of players, dynamically shifting the spawnrate of the ZEDs up and down depending on how well the team is doing, and many more.

While these adjustments are certainly interesting, they have the capability of introducing a level of variability that does not always contribute to a consistent, balanced, and team-oriented experience.

One of the pillars of CD's functionality is the ability to exert **full control** over these variables, by allowing one to set them to a **fixed value** that remains intact under all circumstances. **CD also allows for setting these variables far outside of their usual bounds**, allowing for creating scenarios in which the difficulty level is either easier or harder than what is normally available in the game.

Traditionally, CD has been used to create an experience that is equivalent to “harder than Hell on Earth” difficulty, however its main purpose actually lies in providing a *consistent* experience.

This makes it ideal for speed runs, challenges, and tournaments like this one!

Through CD, the following can be achieved:
- Static ZED health values
- Static ZED spawn rate
- Fleshpounds and Quarter Pounds never spawn enraged
- All waves have the same number of ZEDs
- All waves have the same composition of ZEDs
- All waves spawn ZEDs in the same order
- and a lot more, but these are the important ones..


# Section 2: Tournament Administration
### 2.1 - Tournament Staff
**Tournament Director**
- TBD

**Assistant Director(s)**
- TBD

**Commentator(s)**
- TBD

**Streamer(s)**
- TBD

### 2.2 - Disputes
The Tournament Directors are the sole arbiters and court of last resort for all disputes. Their decisions are final and cannot be appealed.

### 2.3 - Sanctions
The Tournament Directors reserve the right to impose any sanction on any competitor or individual player at their sole discretion as circumstances may warrant.

### 2.4 - Conflicts of Interest
**Members of the Tournament Staff are permitted to participate in the tournament.** Where there may be an appearance of a conflict of interest, a staff member will yield to a counterpart if possible.

**Tournament Commentators** and **Streamers** who are also playing in the tournament are subject to the following restrictions:
- Streaming/commentating of ANY matches directly involving the streamer's/commentator's own team is strictly forbidden.
- For matches in any round of the Group Stage, it is forbidden to stream a match UNLESS the match takes place at a time AFTER the streamer's/commentator's own team's match has already completed for that round.
- Streaming/commentating is forbidden in the Playoffs stage if the streamer's/commentator's team is still a part of the tournament at the time the match takes place.


# Section 3: Tournament Structure
### 3.1 - Schedule
**Note:** This schedule is subject to change at any time.

#### [Preliminary Schedule]
```
TBD
```
#### [Group Stage Schedule]
```
TBD
```
#### [Playoffs Schedule]
```
TBD
```

### 3.2 - Format
The tournament will consist of two stages:
- [Group Stage](#321---group-stage)
- [Playoffs](#322---playoffs)

#### 3.2.1 - Group Stage
In the **Group Stage**, all teams play in a series of **rounds** with the goal being to achieve qualification for the **Playoffs.**

The Group Stage consists of **three rounds**, each lasting for **seven days**. Each round takes place on a predetermined map using predetermined [CD Parameters](#82---cd-parameters). These parameters shall be announced the day the round officially begins. **For each round of the Group Stage, all teams play using the same parameters.**

There are no brackets in this stage. Instead, ALL teams play simultaneously and aim to achieve the best results they can for a given round. Matches are **scored** using a new [Scoring System](#section-7-scoring) created specifically for this tournament.

Teams are responsible for **practicing, scheduling,** and eventually **playing** a single game per round using the required settings. The score earned for the match is taken as the team's score for that round. **There are no retries or redos.** Once a team's score has been set for a round, it cannot be set again. A team's score for a round is added to a running total, to be used to determine the standings for the **Playoffs** bracket(s).

#### 3.2.2 - Playoffs
The **top four** teams by **cumulative score** (total score across all rounds) from the Group Stage advance to the Playoffs. **All remaining teams are eliminated from the tournament.**

The Playoffs utilize a simple **Single Elimination Bracket** structure. The initial pairings/matchups of this bracket are determined using the teams' cumulative scores from the Group Stage.

#### [Semifinals]
The first set of matches played in the Playoffs are known as the **Semifinals.** This stage begins shortly after the end of the Group Stage.

**Teams play against one another in inverse-corresponding pairs based on their cumulative scores:**
- The team with the **highest cumulative score** plays against the team with the **lowest cumulative score.**
- The team with the **second-highest cumulative score** plays against the team with the **second-lowest cumulative score.**
- ..and so on..

In this stage, **both teams play a single game individually.** Teams playing in this stage have **one week** to schedule and play a match. The team that earns the highest score wins the match and advances to the **Finals.**

#### [Finals]
The final match of the tournament is held between the two teams that advanced from the Semifinals.

This stage begins **immediately after the last Semifinals match is played** and extends until no later than **Feb 14.** This means that the earlier the Semifinals matches are played, the more time may allotted for the remaining two teams to practice, coordinate, and play the final match. 

In this stage, **both teams play two games in a row.** The cumulative score earned across both games becomes the team's final score for the match. The team that earns the highest score wins the tournament.

### 3.3 - Map Pool
This list is subject to change at any time and does not necessarily represent the exact order the maps shall be played.

```
TBD
```


# Section 4: Registration Process
### 4.1 - Registration
The regular registration period begins `TBD` and closes on `TBD`, lasting exactly `TBD`.

### 4.2 - Double Registration
Players may not register to play in the same tournament more than once. Submitting multiple registrations will cause all registrations to be revoked and may result in further disciplinary action at the discretion of the Tournament Staff.

### 4.3 - Overflow Pool
Following the conclusion of the **regular registration** period, the **Overflow Pool** shall be formed. If more players have signed up than there are available Captains, and there are not enough extra players to form a new team, the extra players shall be moved to the Overflow Pool. Players in the pool shall be **grouped by experience** (see [5.22](#522---player-grouping) for more information) and further prioritized by the date and time they signed up.

The purpose of this player pool is to function as a buffer of additional participants. In the event that a team loses players during the competition, the appropriate player group buffer shall be drawn from in order of priority in order to fill the vacant slot on the team.

After the regular sign-ups close, **players can continue to sign up for the tournament until the beginning of the first round of the Group Stage.** Players who sign up at this time shall be automatically placed into the Overflow Pool.

### 4.4 - Banned Players
Players who have already been banned from Tamari’s KF2 Servers for any reason are barred from participating in this tournament and any applications or sign-ups from these users shall be discarded.

Players shall be required to submit their STEAMID during the sign-up phase, which shall be checked against our global bans list.

Integrity is of the utmost importance. If a Steam account possesses a **VAC Ban** or **Game Ban**, the account holder shall be required to explain why they were banned. Refusing shall be seen as suspicious and may result in the sign-up being revoked.

### 4.5 - Names
All players shall be required to give a name during the registration phase. **Players shall be required to use these names for the duration of the tournament.**

If a player must change their name, the Tournament Staff must be informed. It is permitted for players to make minor adjustments to their name (such as adding clan tags or symbols to denote their team) without having to inform the Tournament Staff.

**Names displaying obscenities or showing an overall lack of maturity or sensitivity will not be tolerated and can result in the team's suspension from the tournament.**


# Section 5: Team Structure
### 5.1 - Team Roster
A single team shall contain the following members in its roster:
- 1 **Captain**
- 1 **Co-Captain**
- 6 **Players**

Though there can only be six players in-game at a time, a full roster contains eight players, allowing for two backup players to be available in the event that players are unable to make it to the match.

### [Captain]
The team’s **Captain** shall be an experienced player who possesses a high degree of skill, knowledge, and experience within CD.

**The Captain is the team leader and is ultimately responsible for their team.**

Captains are primarily required to coordinate with Tournament Staff and other Captains for scheduling matches and resolving disputes / other administrative-level endeavors. Captains are typically handpicked by Tournament Staff, but players can opt to sign up to be a Captain as well. In the second scenario, a review shall be conducted by the Tournament Staff to determine eligibility. This shall be based on several factors, including game time (hours) / general knowledge of the game, player attitude, and overall performance in CD matches.

**The Captain’s secondary objective in this tournament is to act as a coach**, sharing their knowledge with their teammates and training them to improve their skill and game knowledge.

### [Co-Captain]
The team's **Co-Captain** shall be the secondary leader.

The Co-Captain can be a player of any skill level that has not already been assigned to a team and is handpicked by the Captain directly. The Co-Captain is responsible for filling in for the Captain when needed and is the Captain’s primary support. Players who do not desire the full responsibility of leadership, but still want to be in a team-wide supporting role will likely find this position to be ideal. Like Captains, players can sign up to be Co-Captains as well.

### 5.2 - Team Formation
The formation of teams is conducted in five distinct phases:
- [Player Sign-ups](#521---player-sign-ups)
- [Player Grouping](#522---player-grouping)
- [Captain Assignment](#523---captain-assignment)
- [Co-Captain Assignment](#524---co-captain-assignment)
- [Player Draft](#525---player-draft)

#### 5.2.1 - Player Sign-ups
As in [4.1](#41---registration), players sign up to participate in the tournament through the supplied form. Sign-ups open the day the tournament is announced and remain open for **28 days.**

On the signup form, an option is given that allows the participant to specify their preferred role within the team, either **Captain**, **Co-Captain**, or **Player**. Note that a player’s specified preference may not reflect their actual assigned role when the teams are finally established.

The number of players that sign up directly influences the number of Captains that can be chosen (and therefore the maximum number of teams).

#### 5.2.2 - Player Grouping
After sign-ups close, the Tournament Staff will divide the registered players into **Player Groups** based on their experience level.

There are three Groups:
- **Group 1:** Players possessing a high amount of experience within CD
- **Group 2:** Players possessing an average or above average amount experience within CD
- **Group 3:** New or lesser-experienced players

These groups exist to better ensure a more even balance between teams and become relevant when the teams are actually filled out with players.

#### 5.2.3 - Captain Assignment
Next, **Captains** are to be chosen/selected. Most of the time, these individuals shall be chosen before the selection process even begins by the Tournament Staff directly. However, in the event that players have signed up to become Captains, the Tournament Staff will review those applications at this time.

**The number of Captain slots available is limited by the number of players participating in the tournament.** This is to ensure each team has a full roster.

#### 5.2.4 - Co-Captain Assignment
Once the Captains have been chosen, each shall be asked to select a **Co-Captain** to help them lead their team. **This can be anyone currently in the pool of registered players, regardless of skill level.**

Captains shall be informed of the players who have directly expressed an interest in being a Co-Captain, however this does not mean that Captains are necessarily required to choose those players.

**Co-Captain selection is done on a first come first serve basis.**

There must be written confirmation from both the Captain and the prospective Co-Captain for the assignment to be finalized.

#### 5.2.5 - Player Draft
When all Captain and Co-Captain pairs have been established, the **Player Draft** phase shall begin. In this phase, the remaining players are selected by the Captains using the previously-formed Player Groups.

To start the process, all Captains shall be placed into a hat and shuffled to produce a random ordering. **This represents the order in which the Captains will choose prospective teammates.** Random ordering is used to prevent any bias and/or favoritism in the process.

Once the order has been set, actual assignment of the players shall begin.

To start, Captains will take turn choosing players from **Group 3** in a Round Robin fashion as per the order established previously. For example, the first Captain picks a player, then the second, then the third, and so on. This process continues until all of the players in the group have been selected.

The same process then repeats for the players in **Group 2.**

..and finally again for **Group 1.**

The result of this process is (hopefully) a set of teams which have a similar average skill level across their rosters due to the even distribution of players of varying experience.

**Note** The Tournament Staff reserve the right to make adjustments to team rosters as they see fit to ensure the best possible balance. This, however, will only be exercised in extreme cases.

### 5.3 - Roster Integrity
Teams may *only* use the players in the rosters formed from [5.2.5](#525---player-draft). If a player leaves, exits, or is removed from the team, the team Captain is required to inform the Tournament Staff immediately so that a replacement can be found (typically drawn from the overflow pool).

STEAMIDs shall be checked regularly. **Using players not in the team’s assigned roster is grounds for the team's immediate suspension from the tournament.**

#### 5.3.1 - Alternate Accounts
**Alternate accounts are not allowed under any circumstances.** Please make sure that the account you intend to play on has full access to the game.


# Section 6: Match Scheduling
### 6.1 - Rounds & Scheduling
Pairings, brackets, and other pertinent information for each round shall be posted by the Tournament Staff at the beginning of the round.

### 6.2 - Scheduling Duties
For all phases of the tournament, matches must be confirmed with the Tournament Staff at least **48 hours** before the projected match start time to allow for time to prepare.

**It is the responsibility of all Captains involved in a given match to schedule and finalize match times with one another and relay these times to the Tournament Staff.**

### 6.3 - Scheduling Format
Team Captains shall submit the following to the Tournament Staff when scheduling a match:
- The **Start Time** AND **Date** for the match, *with time zones*
- The preferred **Server Region** (e.g. US, EU, AS)

### 6.4 - Scheduling Deadline
The **Scheduling Deadline** refers to the point in time after which teams are no longer able to schedule matches. Note that this does not mean the match must be *played* by this deadline, but rather *scheduled*.

In the **Group Stage**, the Scheduling Deadline is **48 hours** before the end of the round. For example, if the round ends on **Jan 6 @ 23:59 EST**, then the latest that a match can be scheduled for that round is on **Jan 4 @ 23:59 EST**, exactly **48 hours** before.

In the **Playoffs**, the Captains from both teams are required to coordinate a time to play their games and relay this information to the Tournament Staff at least **48 hours** before the agreed-upon match start time. The earlier, the better.

### 6.5 - Matches With Multiple Games
#### 6.5.1 - Intermission
For matches where a single team plays multiple games (such as during the Playoffs), there must be **no scheduled intermission** between games. In other words, the games must be each be played "back-to-back". Teams are allowed a maximum of **ten minutes** between each individual game to be back in the server and readied up to begin the next game.

#### 6.5.2 - Substitutions
**Substitutions ARE allowed, but ONLY between games.** Substitutions **cannot** be made *during* a single game in a match, barring major emergencies, for which exceptions can and shall be made within reason. Otherwise, there are no exceptions to this rule and violation will result in the team receiving a **zero score** for the match. Please ensure that players have allotted enough time to be present at all individual games in a specified matchup.

### 6.6 - Matches Between Two Teams
For matches that occur between two separate teams (for example during the Playoffs), **an eight hour grace period is to be granted between each teams' individual set of games.**

For example, if Team A schedules their match on **March 1 @ 12:00 PM**, then Team B's game(s) must begin **no earlier than March 1 @ 4:00 AM (8 hours prior)** and **no later than March 1 @ 8:00 PM (8 hours after)**. Note that the eight hour grace period is applied relative to the **start time** of the **first game in the set** specifically, rather than the time the team finishes playing *all* of their game(s). This means that if Team A schedule to play their set of games at some time, then Team B has eight hours from that time to play their game(s). Team B need not *finish* their game(s) by the end of the grace period, but rather *start* them.

This grace period is to account for the differing timezones within an individual team and is aimed to ease some of the pressure of scheduling for the Captains.

**If possible, the best case scenario would involve both teams playing back-to-back.** This situation would provide ultimate convenience for the teams as well as the Tournament Staff in attendence.

Also, please note that **this is an international tournament.** By signing up to play, competitors are expected to understand that their opponents may be based in a distant time zone, which means that some or all players in a team may be required to play at inopportune / abnormal times throughout the day. To help remedy this, Captains should be prompt and negotiate the schedule for the match as early as possible.

For all matches between two teams where each team plays multiple games in a row, the rules outlined in [6.5](#65---matches-with-multiple-games) still apply.

### 6.7 - Servers
Only specific servers may be used to play matches. See [Section 12: Servers](#section-12-servers) for more information.

### 6.8 - Tardiness
Each team has **15 minutes** after the scheduled time to have six players in the server and readied up.

Please be on time. It is disrespectful to your opponents, the Tournament Staff who have given up some of their time to attend, and finally to the viewers who have committed time to watching the match. **Please plan to join the server 10-15 minutes before the start time to reduce the likelihood of being late.**

**The standard penalty for tardiness shall be a zero score for the match.** In the Playoffs, this constitutes a **forfeit loss** in the event that one team is late to the match, or a **double forfeit** if both teams are late.

In the event one team is disqualified, **it is still required that the second team play their round in full.**

If something comes up that might affect the team’s ability to be present at the planned time, Captains are required to inform the Tournament Staff as soon as possible so that accommodations can be made. The earlier we are informed, the better.

### 6.9 - No-shows
No-shows distort the results by unbalancing the tiebreakers. Moreover, they disappoint other competitors who have joined the tournament to participate in the competition.

If you wish to withdraw from the tournament, please notify one of the tournament directors by the start of the **second round** of the Group Stage.

In the Group Stage, if a team fails to appear to any match, a **zero score** shall be assigned and that team must then contact Tournament Staff to confirm that they will play in the next round **by the scheduling deadline for that round**. Failure to do this will result the **team's removal from the tournament** without notice.

In the Playoffs, if a team fails to appear to any match, a zero score shall be assigned and that team shall be **eliminated** from the tournament automatically.

### 6.10 - Ringers & Substitutions
A **ringer** is a player not part of the team's active roster who substitutes to fill out the roster for a given match.
**Utilizing ringers is not allowed in this tournament**.

Substitutions **ARE** allowed, but **ONLY** using players from the team's **established** roster. Furthermore, substitutions can *only* be made **between** games in a set, and not *during* a game, barring extenuating circumstances. See [6.5.2](#652---substitutions) for more information.

The above regulation includes matches where multiple games are played in a row (e.g. during the Playoffs phase). See [6.5.2](#652---substitutions) for more information. Situations presenting extenuating circumstances shall be handled as deemed appropriate by Tournament Staff at the moment of occurrence.

Additionally, teams are **not permitted** to add new players to their roster in the event that a member drops out of or is removed from the tournament. **Should a vacancy be created in a team for any reason, the team Captain must inform the Tournament Staff as soon as possible so that a player may be drawn from the Overflow Pool.**

### 6.11 - Captain Participation
**The Captain and Co-Captain are not required to play in matches in this tournament, however they are strongly encouraged to participate in order to better lead their team.**

### 6.12 - Proof of Play
"Proof of Play" refers to the team providing evidence or "proof" that a match was played in its entirety and with respect to the rules outlined in this document.

Proof of play is **always** required, *EXCEPT* in the case that a match is streamed by an official Tournament Streamer.

When proof of play is required, the following **must** be provided:
1. A **recording** or **stream POV** of the match. This can be from any player on the team. Note that **spectators** are *not* allowed, so the player recording/streaming the match **must** be one of the active players. See [8.5](#85---spectators) for more information.
2. A screenshot of the end-game scoreboard *with all players present*

**ALL** of the above items are required to serve as suitable proof of play. **This means that all matches must be recorded and/or streamed by at least one player on the team.** The team's **Captain** must deliver these directly to the one of the Tournament Directors following the conclusion of the match.

In the best case, failure to provide proof of play will result in a team being forced to **replay the match**. The replayed match shall be subject to the **Scheduling Deadline**, should one exist.
In the worst case, a team will earn a **zero score** for the match.

**Please be honest. All match results shall be recorded by the server automatically. If a screenshot/recording/etc does not match our recorded statistics, it shall be considered cheating and the team may be disqualified from the tournament entirely.**

### 6.13 - Multiple Attempts
#### 6.13.1 - Group Stage
In the **Group Stage**, teams are permitted to make a **single re-attempt** at a match in the event that the squad is wiped out.

**In the event that the second attempt results in a VICTORY (boss killed), the team suffers a 50% reduction to the Total Score earned**. This reduction occurs **after** all bonuses and penalties are applied to the Total Score. The score reduction cannot reduce the team's score beyond the maximum value of the Completion Score (CS) for the match. See [Section 7: Scoring](#section-7-scoring) for more information.

Additionally, for ANY re-attempted match, **the newly-earned score supersedes the score earned in the original attempt, even if the original score was higher, and regardless of whether or not the score penalty was actually applied to the retried run.**

In the event that a crash occurs (either player or server), a retry may be granted by the Tournament Staff. See [6.14](#614---loss-of-connection) for more information. Retries as a result of a loss of connection are considered separately from retries made as the result of the squad being wiped out.

Otherwise, there are no exceptions to the above regulations, though the Tournament Staff shall retain the right to make them as deemed necessary.

#### 6.13.2 - Playoffs
In the Playoffs phase, **multiple attempts are strictly forbidden** except in the case where a crash occurs. See [6.14](#614---loss-of-connection) for more information.

There are no formal exceptions to the above regulations, though the Tournament Staff shall retain the right to make them as deemed necessary.

#### 6.13.3 - Integrity & Sportsmanship
Retries may **only** be used in the situations outlined in [6.13.1](#6131---group-stage)/[6.13.2](#6132---playoffs) **and** if the current stage of the tournament permits it. **It is considered bad sportsmanship to purposely throw the game or manipulate the game's state in order to earn a retry.** Tournament Staff reserve the right to enact disciplinary measures if it is determined this is being abused.

For matches that are not streamed by an official Tournament Streamer, *Proof of Play* (described in [6.12](#612---proof-of-play)) is required. **Records of all tournament matches played on the Match Servers are kept automatically by the server.** These reports will clearly display tampering should a team attempt to abuse this clause.

**It is considered a breach of Competitive Integrity to make more attempts at a match than are allowed, especially if the team attempts to hide or obfuscate the results of these attempts from the Tournament Staff in any way. Consequences for violation at minimum involve the team being assigned a zero score for the round, and at maximum, explusion from the tournament entirely and banned from all future events held by the Tamari's KF2 community.**

### 6.14 - Loss of Connection
There are situations in which either the clients or the server may lose connection. These are handled separately in two subcases:

#### 6.14.1 - Client Disconnects
In the event that players crash or are disconnected involuntarily at other points throughout the match, Tournament Directors and Assistant Directors reserve the right to adjust all Score and Bonus values as well as the Match Timer to compensate if the situation presents extenuating circumstances. **There is no guarantee in these scenarios and the Tournament Director and Assistant Directors are the court of last resort for deciding whether or not points are to be reimbursed.** Their decisions are final and cannot be appealed.

#### 6.14.2 - Server Disconnects
In the event that the **server** itself crashes or otherwise loses connection, Tournament Directors in attendance are **permitted** to set the game state, which includes:
- Changing the wave manually
- Granting Dosh
- Setting Score and Bonus values manually
- Setting the Match Timer manually
... so that play may resume as normal.

In situations where a match was not streamed by an official Tournament Streamer, incontrovertible evidence must be provided to the Tournament Director(s) and Assistant Director(s) that shows that the server crashed on its own without the direct interference of any of the players present before any actions can be taken.

#### 6.14.3 - Restarts
In the event of a Loss of Connection, a team may request a restart with no penalty provided that the event occurred **prior to the beginning of Wave 3**. After the beginning of Wave 3, restarts in the wake of a crash or disconnect shall (formally) be forbidden. This is primarily for the respect of the time of all parties involved in the match as well as the spectators/viewers.

It shall be the responsibility of the Tournament Staff in attendance (specifically the Assistant Directors and/or the Director) to approve/deny a request to restart in the wake of a client or server crash/disconnect. Only one restart may be made **per match** in this manner. Should a match consists of multiple games, **only one restart** shall be allowed between all games.

After a restart, should further action be necessary, the Assistant Director and/or the Director shall be permitted to take action as they see fit to resolve the situation. In general, the Assistant Directors and/or the Director shall retain the authority to partially or completely supersede this clause at their own discretion should circumstances warrant it.

#### 6.14.4 - Integrity & Sportsmanship
As in [6.13.3](#6133-integrity---sportsmanship), integrity and sportsmanship are demanded from players in regards to the above clauses.

For client disconnections, it is seen as a breach of Competitive Integrity to frame an intentional disconnection as a crash or loss of internet service with the intent of achieving an advantage or otherwise circumventing the rules. For server disconnections, it is seen as a breach of Competitive Integrity to intentionally abuse an exploit or bug that would cause the server to crash or disconnect players with the intent of achieving an advantage or otherwise circumventing the rules. 

Consequences for violation at minimum involve the team being assigned a zero score for the round, and at maximum, explusion from the tournament entirely and banned from all future events held by the Tamari's KF2 community.

### 6.15 - Oversight
Teams are permitted to ask a Tournament Director or Assistant Director to be present at the match to provide oversight and resolve any disputes.


# Section 7: Scoring
All matches played in this tournament are scored using a unique **Scoring System**. The Scoring System assigns teams **Points** based on their overall performance in the match.

### 8.3 - Streaming & Casting
All matches shall be streamed primarily at any the following links:
- http://www.twitch.tv/TamariTM

**Teams are NOT permitted decline their match(es) being streamed.**

**All members of a team ARE permitted (and are welcome) to record, stream, and upload their matches to their personal media accounts.** The tournament organization does not own the content players produce from their matches.

For matches that are streamed on the official channels, commentators and streamers shall be present to shoutcast the match.

Though they are part of the Tournament Staff, commentators and streamers are **NOT** admins. Should an issue arise that requires the attention of an admin, one of the tournament directors should be contacted immediately.

Despite this, commentators and streamers still exercise some control over the match as **referees**. Should something occur that either partially or completely violates one of the rules, they are permitted to ask the offending players to stop or take other appropriate actions within reason.

If all else fails, a Tournament Director should be informed as soon as possible so that appropriate further action can be taken.

**The tournament organization does not own the content created from the matches by the commentators and streamers.** Commentators and streamers are free to upload their recordings to their own media channels, however the Tournament Staff is also permitted to download and upload the recordings to the official tournament channel(s).

As stated in [2.4](#24---conflicts-of-interest), **Tournament Commentators** and **Streamers** who are also playing in the tournament are subject to the following restrictions:
- Streaming/commentating of ANY matches directly involving the streamer's/commentator's own team is strictly forbidden.
- For matches in any round of the Group Stage, it is forbidden to stream a match UNLESS the match takes place at a time AFTER the streamer's/commentator's own team's match has already completed for that round.
- Streaming/commentating is forbidden in the Playoffs stage if the streamer's/commentator's team is still a part of the tournament at the time the match takes place.

### 8.4 - Voice Chat
Teams will each be assigned a Voice Channel in the Tournament Discord Server that they are **required** to use for the match, even if they do not intend to use it to communicate with one another.

Furthermore, **only the players currently playing in the match are allowed to be in Voice Chat.** Both the Captain and Co-Captain are subject to this rule as well. Violating this will result in receiving a **zero score** for the match and possible suspension from the tournament.

#### 8.4.1 - War Rooms
War Rooms shall be utilized in this tournament. A War Room refers to the streamers and commentators occasionally dropping into the team’s Voice Chat room to “listen in”. War Rooms will typically last for about 30 seconds and will only occur a few times per match.

**Teams are allowed to veto the use of their Voice Channel as a War Room.** The team Captain must inform the Tournament Staff of this decision prior to the match Start Time.

Commentators will not speak nor create any distractions when entering a channel, and players should generally not feel disturbed by their presence.

### 8.5 - Spectators
Aside from Tournament Staff and other authorized parties (such as commentators and streamers), no Spectators shall be allowed in the server at any time during a match.

This includes members of the team who are not playing in the match. If a non-participating team member joins the server as a spectator, the team will receive a **zero point score** for the round.

### 8.6 - Perks
#### 8.6.1 - Perk Limits
There are limits in place on the Perk composition the team can possess at any given time:
- Maximum **one of each** Berserker, Field Medic, Commando, SWAT, Support, Demolitionist, Firebug, Survivalist
- Maximum **two total** from the Perk Group:
  - Berserker
  - Demolitionist
  - Firebug
  - Survivalist
- Maximum **two of each** Sharpshooter, Gunslinger
- Field Medic and Demolitionist are **mutually exclusive** and cannot co-exist on a team

These limitations are **strictly** enforced. Not adhering to the requirements will result in the team receiving a **zero score** for the match!

#### 8.6.2 - Perk Swapping
In the Lobby, players are freely allowed to change Perks, however after the match starts, **players will no longer be able to select a new Perk for the remainder of the match.**

#### 8.6.3 - Perk Skills
There are no restrictions on the changing of **Perk Skills** in this tournament. Players can alter their Perk's skills as often as they desire during the Trader period.

#### 8.6.4 - Perk Modifications
Some Perks (and their skills) have been modified in this tournament. The modifications made are as follows:
#### Berserker
```diff

- Berserker Rage skill healing reduced to 25%, down from 50%.
- Berserker Rage skill no longer affects Large ZEDs at all.
+ Resistance skill damage resistance restored to 25%, with 25% additional resistance to Poison and Sonic damage, up from 15%.
+ Parry skill damage resistance restored to 40% for 8 seconds, up from 30% for 8 seconds.
+ Passive damage resistance bonus restored to 3% per 5 levels (15% @ L25), up from 2% per 5 levels (10% @ L25).
```
#### Field Medic
```diff
- Resilience skill damage resistance reduced to 50%, down from 60%.
- Resilience skill now reduces the Field Medic's maximum Armor by 100%.
+ Symbiotic Health skill healing amount increased to 8%, up from 6%.
+ Passive Armor bonus restored to 3% per level (175 @ L25), up from 2% per level (150 @ L25).
```
#### Sharpshooter
```diff
- Ranger skill reverted to increase the Stun Power of Perk Weapons by 300%, instead of granting an instant stun.
```
#### Survivalist
```diff
- Lockdown skill reverted to increase incapacitation powers of all weapons by 200%, instead of granting an instant stun.
- Grenade selection is disabled. The only usable grenade is the HE Grenade.
```

### 8.7 - Weapons
#### 8.7.1 - Banned Weapons
The following Weapons are **banned** and are prohibited from being used in this tournament:
- **Sharpshooter:** M99 AMR, Rail Gun, HRG Beluga Beat, Compound Bow, HRG Head Hunter
- **Gunslinger:** HRG Winterbite, Piranha Pistol, HRG Disruptor
- **Field Medic:** HRG Incision, HRG Healthrower, Hemoclobber, HMTech-501 Grenade Rifle
- **Survivalist:** HRG Arc Generator, Killerwatt, Freezethrower, Reducto Ray
- **Berserker:** HRG Teslauncher
- **Firebug:** Thermite Bore, Microwave Gun
- **Demolitionist:** Gravity Imploder, HRG Kaboomstick
- **Support:** HRG Blast Brawlers, Frost Fang, Blunderbuss
- **SWAT:** HRG Bastion, Glock 18 & Riot Shield, HRG Stunner

**Banned weapons are completely removed from the Trader Pod and shall be completely inaccessible.** If a weapon is **Cross-Perk** and it is banned for one Perk, then it is banned for all other Perks that can use the weapon as well.

#### 8.7.2 - DLC Weapons
All **DLC Weapons** which are not banned shall be automatically unlocked on the tournament servers, even if no player on the team actually owns the weapons.

#### 8.7.3 - Weapon Upgrade Restrictions
The following **Weapon Upgrades** are restricted:
- Weapons cannot be upgraded to Tier 5
- The Desert Eagle cannot be upgraded

#### 8.7.4 - Weapon Modifications
Several weapons have been modified for use in this tournament. The modifications made are as follows:

#### Hemogoblin
```diff
+ Tier increased from 3 to 4.
- Trader price increased from 1100 to 1500.
- Healing per dart reduced to from 25 to 18.
- Time to fully recharge increased from 10s to 14s.
```
#### HRG Crossboom
```diff
- Self-damage multiplier increased from 0.25 to 0.50.
```

### 8.8 - Mechanics
Several game mechanics have been modified for use in this tournament. The modifications made are as follows:

#### ZED Stomping (aka "Goomba Stomping")
ZED Stomping has been reverted to its pre-nerf state.
This means that any and all ZEDs can be stomped (excluding bosses) and there is also no cooldown on stomps.

#### Afflictions (aka "debuffs" or "incaps")
Afflictions in the vanilla game have been mistakenly broken by TWI in recent updates to the game, and are either more powerful or significantly weaker than intended (in specific cases). Some examples of Afflictions are Stun, Stumble, and Freeze. In most cases, all of these sources were either multiplying or dividing their effects, resulting in unintended behavior.

These issues have been fixed entirely on our servers. Though the current state of the Affliction system is broken in the vanilla game, I am still listing our fixed version as a "deviation" since the broken state is technically the new "norm".

Examples of what is fixed/reverted:
```diff
- Gunslinger Nail Bombs no longer instantly stun targets.
+ Sharpshooter Freeze Grenades and SWAT Flashbangs no longer sometimes fail.
+ All sources of Afflictions now properly apply, instead of sometimes doubling or tripling their effects.
```
#### Perk Skills that alter Maximum Health
In the base game, some Perk Skills can be exploited to infinitely earn money, namely those skills which increase or decrease the player's maximum health.

These skills have been modified such that the player will now be automatically completely healed should their health already be at 100% upon switching skills. If the player's health is below 100%, their health will not be set automatically. This is to allow Field Medics to heal the player and earn Dosh from the healing. However, once the player is at 100% Health, it shall be impossible to lose health due to players being invincible during the Trader period.

The skills affected include:
```prolog
1. Berserker: Dreadnaught
2. Commando: Tenacious
3. Support: Fortitude
4. Field Medic: Symbiotic Health
```

### 8.9 - Map Objectives
Throughout the match, objectives in the form of “Stand Your Ground” zones will appear. Some maps have built-in objectives as well, such as KF-Airship.

Completing these objectives grants **200 Bonus** points to the team (see [Section 7: Scoring](#section-7-scoring) for more information on this).

For a given map, Stand Your Ground objectives will appear at a static location on each wave they are offered. This does not necessarily mean that they will always appear at the same location for all waves, but rather that they will always appear at the same location on that wave in particular. Furthermore, SYGs will appear on the same waves for each run of an individual map to keep things fair for all teams.

If the next wave has a set objective, the Objective Zone shall be **highlighted** in the world (and on the HUD) during the Trader period. This is so that players can take note of the exact position of the zone and adjust their strategies as necessary.

### 8.10 - Trader Time
During Trader Time, the following is in effect:
- **ALL** Trader Pods in the map are open simultaneously
- Trader Timer increased to **120 seconds** (2 minutes)
- Players move at **200%** movement speed
- The **!ot** and **!fs** commands are disabled

All Trader Pods are open to ensure equality and fairness across runs and to help prevent random factors from influencing the outcome of the match. The additional time and increased movement speed are necessary to allow teams to properly prepare for the next wave.

**The Trader Timer will not pause automatically.** Although this is the typical behavior in CD, it is restricted in this tournament to prevent teams from consuming an unfair amount of time during the Trader period to prepare. It is not possible for teams to vote to Pause (!pt) or Unpause (!upt) the Trader.

### 8.11 - Custom Interface
#### 8.11.1 - Player Interface
![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/LSTryek.png)

During the match, players will find that a new **Match Timer** has been added at the top-middle of their screen.

This timer shows the following:
- Total **duration** of the current match (excluding any time spent in the Lobby)
- The **Par Time** for the map
- The **Max Time** for the map

The timer begins counting the moment the round begins and never stops, even during the Trader period. See [Section 7: Scoring](#section-7-scoring) for more information on the Par Time and Max Time.

#### 8.11.2 - Spectator Interface
![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/CDGbiMR.png)

Similarly to players, **spectators/viewers** also have a custom interface for this tournament.

This HUD shows the following information:
1. The **Match Timer**
2. The current **Score** of the match, including all Bonuses
3. A full readout of the team’s **condition**.

As with the Player Interface, the **Match Timer** on the Spectator Interface shows the current total time elapsed for the match, not including any time spent in the Lobby. The Par Time and Max Time are visible as well.

The Score shown in **2)** reflects the total number of Points the team has earned thus far for the match as well as a complete breakdown of the state of the team’s Bonus Point pools. The values shown update in real time.

**3)** shows a complete technical readout of the conditions of each member of the team.

The following information can be viewed in real time:
- The player’s **Health** and **Armor**
- The player’s current **Perk**
- The player’s **currently-equipped Weapon** as well as the amount of **ammunition** loaded and available
- The total number of **Kills** and **Assists** the player has
- The total amount of **Dosh** the player possesses
- The total amount of **weight** the player is carrying in their loadout
- The total number of **grenades** the player has in their inventory

Example of the HUD in action:

# Section 9: Competitive Integrity
### 9.1 - Penalties
The minimum penalty for a breach of competitive integrity is a match loss by forfeit. There is no maximum penalty, which may include team expulsion from the tournament, forfeiture of already played matches, and forfeiture of team eligibility for any prizes.

#### 9.1.1 - Guilt by Association
An entire team may be held responsible for any team member who is found to be breaching competitive integrity. If foul play is suspected, the team must inform Tournament Staff as soon as possible so that the situation can be addressed. The outcome of this situation depends on various factors, and significant proof shall be needed to take any degree of action.

**In scenarios involving a breach of competitive integrity, inaction or lack of cooperation from the team may be seen as a suggestion of possible complicity.**

### 9.2 - Stream Sniping
In matches where two teams play against one another, both teams are required to refrain from viewing each other's streams / shoutcasts until the match has concluded and a winner has been decided.

In the Group Stage, **all teams are required to refrain from watching the other teams' matches until the conclusion of the round,** after which VODs from all matches shall be posted.

### 9.3 - Cheating
**ANY form of cheating, whether through external software or in-engine methods, is absolutely prohibited.**

Cheating ruins the integrity of the sport, undermines the efforts of everyone involved in keeping the game fun and fair, and is a direct form of disrespect to both your team and the tournament administration.

Should a member of a team be caught cheating, the cheater at minimum shall be immediately removed from the tournament and banned from all future events as well as from Tamari’s KF2 servers entirely.

### 9.4 - Permitted Game Modifications
Participants have a duty to conform to the generally accepted standards of fair play. Deviation from those standards is cheating, and threatens the legitimacy of the competition as a whole. Therefore, everyone shall be held to a strict standard of competitive integrity.

#### 9.4.1 - Crosshairs
Use of a **crosshair** of any sort is permitted in this tournament.

#### 9.4.2 - INI Edits
The term “INI Edit” refers to a change made to the game’s base configuration files.

The only INI Edits which are allowed are those which reflect settings already available in the game's built-in options menu, for example:
- Altering video settings to improve performance
- Altering or setting keybinds
- Altering gore/particle/FX settings to improve performance

ALL other edits are **forbidden** and shall be seen as a breach of competitive integrity.

Edits which attempt to completely remove objects from the environment in order to make it easier to see or navigate are especially forbidden, as are edits which attempt to alter the behaviors of weapons, corpses, or thrown objects in any way, as they give players an unfair competitive advantage.

The tournament servers restrict most of these values and enforces them to their defaults should they be found to be in use.

#### 9.4.3 - Local Game Files
The local game files that can be changed are:
- Weapon Skins
- Weapon Sounds
- Game Music
- Menu Sounds / FX

ALL other changes not in the above list are **forbidden** and shall be seen as a breach of competitive integrity.

Changes to ZED models & sounds which attempt to make it easier to see or hear them, and changes to any environmental textures or sounds in an attempt to make it easier to see or navigate the environment are especially forbidden, as they give players an unfair competitive advantage.

The tournament servers restrict the use of alternate ZED models, which ensures that the ZED hitboxes remain intact for all players.

### 9.5 - Prohibited Game Modifications
All other modifications, edits, tools, and utilities NOT listed in [9.4](#94---permitted-game-modifications) are **prohibited** and will result in disciplinary action should it be discerned that a team / player is taking advantage of them.


# Section 10: Exploits
### 10.1 - Permitted Exploits
Though the following exploits are allowed, Tournament Staff and commentators reserve the right to ask players to refrain if they feel they are being abused in a way that reflects unsportsmanlike conduct, distasteful intent, or are otherwise excessive in nature. Failure to comply can result in earning a zero score for the round, or possibly more, dependent on severity. Tournament Staff have full discretion in these matters and are not required to justify their decision(s).

#### 10.2.1 - AI Stuck Spots
Utilizing any spots in a map which cause ZEDs to become completely stuck and unable to move / attack is prohibited.


# Section 11: Unsportsmanlike Conduct
Each participant is expected to conduct themselves respectfully toward others at all times. Abusive, harassing, disrespectful, or otherwise unsportsmanlike conduct will not be tolerated -- neither during a tournament match, nor in any other context.

### 11.1 - Penalties
The minimum penalty for unsportsmanlike conduct is a match loss by forfeit. There is no maximum penalty, which may include team expulsion from the tournament, forfeiture of already played matches, and forfeiture of team eligibility for any prizes.

#### 11.1.1 - Guilt by Association
An entire team may be held responsible for the unsportsmanlike conduct of any team member. Should problems arise within a team, the members of that team are expected to present the issue to the Tournament Staff so that further action can be taken.

**In scenarios involving unsportsmanlike conduct, inaction or lack of cooperation from the team may be seen as a suggestion of possible complicity.**

### 11.2 - Insufficient Effort to Win
Any competitor who, in the judgment of a staff member, has not committed to winning the match is guilty of unsportsmanlike conduct.

### 11.3 - Delay of Game
Intentionally stalling or delaying the progress of the match shall be regarded as unsportsmanlike conduct.

This includes but IS NOT LIMITED to:
- Excessive and/or lengthy use of the game pause feature
- Excessive time spent in the Trader period without readying up
- Excessive time spent completing the wave (such as leaving ZEDs alive without killing them)

These actions disrupt the normal flow of the match and frustrate the expectations of the spectators and other players. They shall be regarded as unsportsmanlike conduct if it is judged by staff to be excessive, regardless of the reason. Tournament Staff have full discretion in these matters and are not required to justify their decision(s).

### 11.4 - Communication to Harass or Impede
Any form of **written, verbal, or other communication** or actions which are excessive, toxic, or otherwise meant to harass players or impede the progress of the match shall be regarded as unsportsmanlike conduct.

This includes but IS NOT LIMITED to:
- Excessive use of text chat in the form of binds or callouts that are spammy in nature (grenade binds are okay)
- Excessive use of text chat in the form of binds or callouts that are toxic or meant to mock/taunt other individuals
- Excessive use of voice chat that does not reflect traditional team communication norms or are spammy and/or obnoxious
- Use of movement mechanics and/or animations which aim to mock or taunt individuals (t-bagging, etc)

These actions disrupt the normal flow of the match and frustrate the expectations of the spectators and other players. They also display a toxic disregard for common courtesy, respect, and maturity and have the capability to hurt the public image of the tournament as a whole. They shall be regarded as unsportsmanlike conduct if it is judged by the Tournament Staff to be excessive, regardless of the reason. Tournament Staff have full discretion in these matters and are not required to justify their decision(s).

### 11.5 - Lack of Professionalism
Any competitor who displays a **lack of professionalism** within their team or to their opponent(s) is guilty of unsportsmanlike conduct.

This includes but IS NOT LIMITED TO:
- In the event of a loss, failing to acknowledge the outcome of the match in a mature and positive way (ie: being a "sore loser")
- Flammatory, abusive, or otherwise toxic behavior toward teammates or opponents for any reason (see [11.4](#114---communication-to-harass-or-impede))
- Excessive celebration and/or behavior akin to "rubbing it in" to teammates or opponents

Just play nice and say GG when the match is over, no matter who wins, and remember that this is just a game. Of all of the forms of unsportsmanlike conduct listed in this section, these shall be held to the highest standard. A lack of professionalism and courtesy hurts the event as a whole and frustrates the expectations of the players who have signed up to play in the event.

### 11.6 - Player Avatars
Do not use Steam Avatars that are grotesque, violent, obscene, or depict other disturbing or offensive imagery such as sexually explicit content, racist logos, or “shock” images. These will not be tolerated and can result in suspension from the tournament.

Players who violate these rules shall be given one chance to change their avatar, after which they shall be removed from the tournament entirely.

### 11.7 - Respect the Server Hosts
Server hosts invest time and money to provide and maintain servers at no charge to anyone using them. This competition depends on their continued generosity. Therefore, do not break the rules of the server being used for the current match(es).
